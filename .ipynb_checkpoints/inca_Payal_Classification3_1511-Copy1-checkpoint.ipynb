      " washington ap  the sale to a russian company of a canadian firm with rights to mine us uranium is again in the news with the department of justice signaling it could appoint a special counsel to look into the matter president donald trump and his supporters have criticized the deal which attracted little attention when it was approved by the obama administration and suggested it may implicate former secretary of state hillary clinton in wrongdoing those allegations have been repeatedly denied by clintons camp and former obama administration officials in addition independent factcheckers have found some of the critics allegations to be flawed or misrepresented a look at the sale of uranium one to russias nuclear energy agency rosatom the deal rosatom acquired a majority stake in uranium one in 2010 and bought the remainder of the company in 2013 because uranium one had holdings in american uranium mines which at the time accounted for about 20 percent of americas licensed uranium mining capacity rosatoms 2010 purchase had to be approved by the committee on foreign investment in the united states that committee known as cfius is made up of officials from nine federal agencies including the state department which clinton ran at the time other agencies represented on the committee include the departments of treasury defense commerce energy and homeland security and the office of the us trade representative the allegations trump and his supporters have accused clinton of overseeing the sale of 20 percent of americas uranium supply to russia they see her alleged role as a scandal particularly amid charges the trump campaign colluded with russia in the 2016 presidential election allegations have also been made that the approval of the sale of uranium one benefited major donors to the clinton foundation raising conflictofinterest questions the matter took on new life after a report last month said the fbi was investigating possible russian attempts to influence the us nuclear sector at the time cfius was considering the sale of uranium one to rosatom the report said members of the committee including clinton should have known about the investigation and it questioned why they would have approved it the facts the rosatomuranium one deal did not sell 20 percent of americas uranium to russia the 20 percent figure cited by critics reflects only licensed uranium mining capacity in the us at the time of the sale not total uranium reserves or even actual production and without a specific license to export uranium from uranium ones mines which it did not have at the time rosatom would not be able to send it to russia or elsewhere in terms of the cfius approval clinton has said she had nothing to do with it as secretary of state she technically had a seat on the panel but most other cabinetlevel members historically have delegated such responsibilities to less senior officials the alleged relationship between the approval of the sale and the clinton foundation was first raised in 2015 by conservative author peter schweizer he and others have pointed to some of the investors in the deal and their ties to former president bill clinton and his foundation in april 2015 the new york times published an article echoing much of the schweizer book including one sensational contention that not long after the russians said they wanted to acquire a majority stake in uranium one bill clinton received $500000 for a speech in moscow the speech was paid for by a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin as it promoted uranium one stock canadian financier frank giustra a top clinton foundation donor sold his company urasia to uranium one which was chaired by ian telfer also a clinton foundation donor giustra has said he sold his stake in the deal in 2007 while hillary clinton and barack obama were vying for the democratic presidential nomination politifact found that the majority of the donations from individuals related to uranium one and urasia were made before and during clintons 2008 presidential campaign  but before she became secretary of state \n",

stood out as one himself red sox owner john henry said in the statement and even with his hall of fame achievements at second base his character and personality outshined it all he will be missed signed out of the old pacific coast league on the same scouting trip that brought williams to fenway park doerr played 14 seasons with the red sox and joined his fishing buddy in the hall of fame in 1986 he had a 288 lifetime average and helped the red sox to the 1946 world series the ninetime allstar often forgave his more accomplished friend for his storied anger and impatience ted couldnt understand mediocre see and i was in that mediocre class doerr told the associated press on his 90th birthday in 2008 which the governor of oregon declared bobby doerr day doerrs modesty was belied by his stats he finished with 2042 hits 223 home runs and 1247 rbis and he once went 414 games without an error  a record at the time his six seasons with at least 100 rbis was not matched by another second baseman for 25 years doerr was inducted into the national baseball hall of fame in 1986 by the veterans committee and the red sox retired his no 1 jersey in 1988 the red sox honored doerr with a 2004 world series ring after breaking their 86year championship drought as a hitter doerr said he was always looking for the fastball figuring he couldnt do much with a breaking ball unless it was a hanging curve i didnt like to hit guys like bob feller doerr told the ap he had a big motion and was a little on the wild side you just had to bow your neck and stay in there he frequently led al second basemen in double plays putouts and assists crediting his fielding skill to endless hours spent bouncing a rubber ball against the front steps of his familys los angeles home he helped the red sox win the al pennant in 1946  the only time his teams got past the yankees  but they lost game 7 of the world series to the st louis cardinals when enos slaughter scored the winning run from first

adopted home after spending a winter fishing for steelhead on the rogue river and meeting his future wife when doerr retired he picked up a bamboo fly rod williams designed and named for him  but doerr still had to pay for it doerr returned to the red sox as a coach from 196769 and was a batting coach for the toronto blue jays in 1980 he was wearing a blue jays cap in a home videotape while debating hitting with williams during a 1987 fishing trip williams maintained a batter needed to swing with a slight uppercut to squarely contact the ball on its downward angle from the pitchers mound doerr favored a level swing convinced that the topspin put on the ball would help it carry the lifelong friendship between doerr williams johnny pesky and dom dimaggio was described by david halberstam in the 2003 book the teammates a portrait of a friendship a statue commemorating that friendship was unveiled at fenway in 2010 doerr was the last surviving member of the group born robert

was 16 when he joined the hollywood stars of the pacific coast league in 1934 and moved with the team to san diego in 1936 where they became the padres thats when doerr met williams then a brash kid out of high school after the 1936 season in san diego doerr spent the winter fly fishing for steelhead in oregon where he fell in love with the teacher in the oneroom schoolhouse after meeting her at a dance the next spring doerr was called up to the red sox to join future hall of fame stars joe cronin jimmie foxx and lefty grove after the following season doerr and monica roseman terpin were married except for the 1945 season which he spent in the navy doerr and his family returned from boston every winter to the rogue river community of illahe which he described as akin to turning the clock back 100 years with cabins lit by kerosene lamps and heated by wood stoves and no indoor plumbing after retiring from baseball doerr moved his family to junction city his wifes hometown so their son don could go to middle school people ask dont you wish you played now doerr said in 1990 no i know the money is better but i just feel fortunate to have played then i think we had more fun we played the game hard but there is so much pressure on these guys  this story has been corrected to show that the name is jimmie foxx not jimmy foxx \n",

wakefield under the purple covering by family and friends before marrying charles bronson after tying the knot she left under the same covers as she made her way to the reception without her new husband at the start of the day she was bundled into the back of a silverblue mercedes and driven over to the prison by official charles bronson lookalike timothy crowley for her wedding ceremony a mobility scooter driven by a woman dressed in a cream pinstripe suit led the wedding car procession just five people witnessed bronson saying i do in a behind closed doors ceremony at the west yorkshire prison which began at 2pm a black saab convertible car with the words free charles bronson emblazoned on the side was also parked outside the ceremony lasted around twoandahalf hours and the party is continuing at the york house hotel nearby with friends and family scroll down for video according to bronsons official lookalike timothy crowley who accompanied ms williamson to the wedding the actress lives and breaths for the prisoner paula lives and breaths prison hardman bronson according to his official lookalike mr crowley 49 says he was on a visit with the couple six weeks ago and he is under no illusions that bronson and paula are madly in love he has been corresponding with the prison hardman for four years and was due to attend the ceremony at hmp wakefield today but said prison staff reneged at the last minute saying they didnt receive the appropriate paperwork on time however mr crowley believes the prison decided against allowing him to attend because they dont want the publicity of milking charlie he said im in constant contact with paula she is a very nice girl and she has had a lot of cyberbullying and trolls saying she is in it for this that and the other which to be fair is very uncalled for i was in a visit with the two of them and you can quite see what she feels for charlie and the connection is there she works tirelessly on this case doing what she can to help him in any way shape or form are they in love im under no illusion to think anything different to be fair she lives and breaths him and vice versa the three of us when we sat in a room we have all been in dark places i think thats why we have a connection i was due to be in there whether they dont want the publicity of milking charlie or putting him in a good light on the outside they seem to think the paperwork didnt go through in time apparently they received it on short notice im told but we think there is an ulterior motive he charlie has told me different things about what is going to happen in the wedding and his words to me some time back my job for charlie is to portray him as a good guy on the outside timothy says he was introduced to the notorious prisoner through paula who spotted pictures of him dressed up like bronson on facebook he said the real bronson has asked him to carry on being his lookalike to portray him as a good guy on the outside mr crowley said i was doing this being a looklike for a good cause its through default i never went out there to be a charles bronson lookalike i purely did it for a good cause i grew it the mustache it was due to come off and then the photo was put on facebook and his fiance approached me and said i looked like charlie it just sprang from there really i didnt want to send the photos into him because he might have thought i was just taking the mickey he loves the photos and we are in pretty much constant contact people still see him as this villain but i truly believe he has served his time now and he deserves a break i write to charlie and he says to me portray me in a good light and get people to sign the petition i think the bottom line is he just wants a positive vibe out there about him the letters and pictures he sends me are all of a positive nature bronson he says is been and gone he says bronson was the loser and salvador is now the bornagain artist he gave up a shotgun and found a paintbrush he is embracing his art he has been a naughty boy we know his misdemeanours but he has gone 14 years over his tariff on the grand scheme of things there are so many people out there when you consider paedophiles terrorists and the like this man has had a very very raw deal indeed i think its high time to work towards getting him out there is definitely another side to him he has got a very big heart i feel for the man i truly do bronsons message is etched in capital letters on a sign swinging in the wind outside the hotel where his bridetobe is staying bronson who signs off the message says if you follow my footsteps youre following a madman so think he labels prison the funny farm and tells youngsters to say no to crime for your mum bronson talks of there being no glamour or achievements in a prison cell and refers to life behind bars as a crp existence the lengthy message reads in full what would i say to youngsters who are about to take the road to crime simple put the brakes on stop and think the facts are simple its a road to hell dont do it you can never get that time back its lost forever gone a waste of life imagine it for years decades try and work out the

arent allowed in britain  we would love it but it wont happen its not ideal you expect it a physical relationship when you get married but im willing to wait she said that salvador had not been violent in the past three years and was instead concentrating on his artwork she added we are not asking for him to be let out tomorrow just get him off segregation where he is now and allow him to progress through the system towards his release he has been a loose cannon in the past however in the past three years since he changed his name to charles salvador he has not committed a violent offence whatsoever his artwork has saved him its his salvation as hes locked up for 22 hours a day after passing a string of violence reductions courses in prison salvador  real name michael peterson

      " being bullied at work dramatically raises the risk of developing diabetes according to new research a danish study of around 46000 people found those picked on by colleagues were 46 percent more likely to fall victim to the lifethreatening illness in the us nearly 20 percent of the workforce reports experience bullying at their places of employment this is the first time the link between bullying and type 2 diabetes has been discovered and scientists suspect the pattern could be related to emotional upset fueling comforteating men are more vulnerable to the phenomenon than their female counterparts  61 percent compared to 36 percent experiencing physical violence or threats at work  usually from customers or patients rather than from colleagues  increased the risk for both sexes by 26 percent dr naja rod an epidemiologist at copenhagen university said being bullied is regarded as a severe social stressor that may activate the stress response and lead to a range of downstream biological processes that may contribute towards the risk of diabetes the researchers suggested changes caused by stress hormones could be responsible as it could harm metabolism and increase the risk of obesity by altering hormonal regulation of appetite the emotional effect of workplace bullying may also trigger comfort eating they said dr rod said it is likely both workplace bullying and violence can induce comfort eating behavior  or increase the risk of experiencing negative emotions  and further contribute to weight gain and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes the workplace bullying institute reported earlier this year that 44 percent of respondents to its annual survey said they thought that workplace bullying had gotten worse since last novembers election the report says that bullying in the us affects an estimated 60 million people in the us dr rods team said previous research has shown issues such as job insecurity and long working hours  with the consequent psychological impacts  are associated with a moderately higher risk of diabetes the study found that nine percent of participants had been exposed to workplace bullying in the previous 12 months  defined as unkind or negative behavior from colleagues about one in every eight people had been on the receiving end of workplace violence  being the target of actions or threats  during the same period the 19280 male and 26625 female participants in denmark sweden and finland were followed for over 11 years the link between workplace bullying and diabetes held even after factors such as education being married which increases social support alcohol consumption mental health problems were taken into account cases of type 2 diabetes were identified using national health register data with 1223 and 930 identified respectively among those exposed to bullying or violence this form of the condition usually comes on in middleage and is linked to lifestyle  such as unhealthy eating dr rod said whilst both bullying and violence represent negative interpersonal relationships they seem to be rooted in separate contexts and are distinct social stressors bullying is psychological aggression  including behaviors such as unfair criticisms isolation and humiliating work tasks the majority of bullies are bosses and in the workplace it almost always comes from inside the victims own company rather than from customers or other outsiders in nearly threequarters of cases documented by the study the bullying is carried out by a manager and 36 percent of bullying victims leave their jobs to escape the stress middleaged workers between 40 and 59 years old were bullied more than others violence on the other hand is more likely to involve physical acts such as pushing or kicking or the threat of these and is generally perpetrated by people from outside such as clients or patients bullying and violence are distinct behaviors and consequently their induced emotions can be different dr rod said there is a moderate and robust association between workplace bullying violence and the development of type 2 diabetes she said as both bullying and violence or threats of violence are common in the workplace we suggest prevention policies should be investigated as a possible means to reduce this risk further study of possible causal pathways for example weight gain negative emotions and the psychological stress response would help to provide an understanding of the causal mechanisms and to develop cost effective interventions dr rod added the study was published in diabetologia \n",

intent to get her fired in an interview with abc news  shaun platt suggested that alcohol was to blame for dallas county assistant district attorney jody warners conduct last friday and said he bears no ill will towards her im used to dealing with drunk passengers on a consistent basis he said i forgive her and im sorry that it cost her her job it was not my intent but you dont treat people that way the driver added that warner has now paid the price for her actions which allegedly included slapping and repeatedly insulting him and he wants people to leave her alone scroll down for audio in a statement to abc the nowformer prosecutor denied ever hitting platt but acknowledged that her behavior on friday night was unacceptable the 32yearold warner however argued that platts recording does not paint the full picture of what happened i cringe whenever i hear or think about the things that i said that night she said the audio doesnt tell you that i was in a situation that made me feel very uncomfortable and i became defensive and eventually angry she added in her statement to abc i never assaulted my driver or touched him in any way all i wanted to do was get home safely that night on friday night platt was driving warner home from a bar when he claims the woman got angry at him for getting lost physically and verbally attacked him and then accused him of kidnapping her she kept saying im assistant da who are theyre gonna believe you or me platt told abc news and i said you know what youre kinda right so i took out my phone and i recorded it he added she actually hit me it was not how i expected my night to go platt captured a portion of his interaction with warner on audio in which the female passenger can be heard hurling expletives at the driver repeatedly calling him an idiot  and a joke and demanding that he take her home despite his pleas that she get out of the car just hours after platt shared the recording with dallas morning news the dallas district attorneys office sent a statement to dailymailcom monday evening announcing warners termination  after careful consideration and a thorough investigation i have decided to terminate ms warner district attorney faith johnson stated although criminal charges have not been filed her behavior is contrary to this offices core principle of integrity and it will not be tolerated as public servants we represent the people of dallas county and are examples of justice professionalism and ethical behavior both inside and outside of the courtroom i will not waiver on my expectation of the highest integrity for myself or my staff  speaking to the dallas morning news  platt said it all started when he picked up warner 32 at capitol pub in old east dallas on friday night the uber driver said warner appeared inebriated and angry and things only got worse after the passenger told him to follow a route that was different from the gps directions which caused him to get lost i said should i make a left up here and she refused to answer me platt said she said you can follow the expletive gps and she became increasingly angry even though i was just trying to get her home according to platt warner continued namecalling and berating him she also slapped him on the shoulder which prompted the driver to pull over on the side of the road and ask the passenger to exit the vehicle she kept calling me stupid she said this was the only job i can get because im so stupid and that i was a retard she hit me on my shoulder that was the final straw platt told abc platt said he wanted to call police right away but decided to give warner a chance to leave on her own as she continued saying she was a da fed up with his customers antics platt ended the ride on the uber app he says warner threatened him that he was never going to work again and told him she knows people who are they going to believe im a district attorney the ridesharing driver quoted warner as warning him platt eventually called 911 to summon police and turned on the recording device oh my god youre going to regret this so much warner says in the audio recording obtained by the morning news she later calls the driver a fing idiot a legitimate retard and stupid i want to go home so badly but youre so stupid i want the cops to come so that they can f you up thats what i want warner tells platt ignoring platts repeated demands that she exit his car warner is heard in the audio telling him im an assistant district attorney so shut the f up the situation then takes an unexpected turn when the 32yearold prosecutor accuses platt of kidnapping her by refusing to take her to her destination even though the driver points out that she is free to leave under the law its recklessly keeping me from when i was going and you have done that  she tells the man youre kidnapping me youre committing a third to firstdegree felony platt again asks the woman to get out but she remains inside his vehicle until the arrival of police the uber driver said he was afraid warner would get him arrested because she introduced herself to the officers as the da and pulled them aside for a chat in the end one of the cops asked himyou good to which platt replied i guess so in retrospect he says he felt intimated warner left the scene in the police cruiser and platt went on to pick up and drop off two more passengers that night according to her linkedin page warner earned her law degree from texas tech university school of law and joined the dallas county district attorneys office in february 2011 working in the crimes against children division before warners firing was announced monday platt said he wanted an apology from warner for her conduct but he did not wish warner to lose her job pete

      " sarpolezahab iran ap  iranian president hassan rouhani launched an investigation tuesday into why government housing built by his hardline predecessor collapsed while others withstood a powerful earthquake near the border with iraq that killed more than 530 people in the kurdish town of sarpolezahab which was reconstructed in the decades since the 1980s war with iraq the outer walls of apartment complexes tumbled away in the magnitude 73 earthquake sunday night the housing was built as a part of the mehr or kindness project of former president mahmoud ahmadinejad some nowhomeless survivors simply wept outside while others angrily showed associated press journalists the destruction done by the quake other buildings near our apartment are not damaged as much because they were built privately said ferdows shahbazi 42 who lived in one of the mehr buildings she sarcastically added this is kindness as the name suggests very well rescuers used backhoes and other heavy equipment to dig through toppled buildings in sarpolezahab home to more than half of the dead the apartment complexes sit next to lush pastures in the almost entirely kurdish province of kermanshah nestled in the zagros mountains along the border with iraq both rescuers and residents stood on the remains of homes looking through the rubble searchers used dogs to comb the debris  just as they have since irans 2003 earthquake in bam that killed 26000 people  although some clerics insist the animals are unclean the quake badly damaged the sarpolezahab hospital forcing the army to set up field clinics the quake also reportedly killed an unspecified number of soldiers in an army garrison aside from the 530 people killed in iran 7817 were injured the staterun irna news agency reported health minister hassan ghazizadeh hashemi who visited kermanshah on tuesday warned that the death toll probably would rise my feeling is that number  will increase since victims were buried in many villages that their exact statistics will be announced in coming days he said according to the semiofficial isna news agency rouhani inspected the damage in the province and offered his support this was a pain for all iranians he said representing the nation of iran i offer my condolences to the people of kermanshah and tell them that all of us are behind kermanshah foreign minister mohammad javad zarif thanked foreign countries offering to help but wrote on twitter for now we are able to manage with our own resources also touring the area was cleric abdolhossein moezi a representative of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei moezi said there was a need for more relief material and security that was echoed by nazar barani the mayor of the town of ezgeleh who told state tv his constituency still had a deep need for food medicine and tents he said 80 percent of the buildings in the town had been damaged the temblor hit about 19 miles 31 kilometers outside the eastern iraqi city of halabja according to the us geological survey and struck 144 miles 232 kilometers below the surface a somewhat shallow depth that can cause broader damage nine people were killed in iraq and 550 were injured all in the countrys northern semiautonomous kurdish region according to the united nations the disparity in casualty tolls has drawn questions from iranians especially because so much of sarpolezahab was new initial iranian government estimates suggest the quake destroyed 12000 apartments and freestanding homes and damaged another 15000 some immediately pointed to the mehr homes about 2 million units were built in iran including scores in sarpole zahab as part of a populist program by ahmadinejad who also offered cash payouts and other incentives to appease the public while iran faced crippling economic sanctions over its nuclear program but after the housing was built some didnt have paved roads or water going to them many warned that the lowquality construction could be a problem in iran which faces neardaily earthquakes and sits on many major fault lines ahmadinejads official channel on the messaging app telegram which is popular in iran called the accusations media slander and said those who circulated photos and videos of damaged mehr homes were clumsy charlatans ahmadinejad adviser ali akbar javanfekr also wrote on a website for allies of the former president heavy waves of propaganda against mehr are aimed at covering up the weakness and inefficiency of the rouhani administration in helping quakehit people in may a magnitude 57 quake in the northeastern city of bojnourd heavily damaged similar mehr projects there many still sit uncompleted across the country because the program ran out of cash rouhani said in sarpolezahab that the government would look into what went wrong at the mehr homes some of which his administration handed over the faults and shortcomings in the construction of these buildings should be investigated he said and the government will surely follow up on these issues and identify the culprits and introduce them to the people rouhani added we saw what happened to the mehr buildings though even a single window was not broken in peoples privately built homes he promised cash payments and loans to those affected so they can build new homes with contractors of their choice he also urged local officials to be generous with disaster relief damage wasnt limited to housing in the nearby kurdish town of eslamabad a hospital only recently inaugurated by the government collapsed killing several people there lawmaker heshmatollah falahatpisheh said several became victims of treason the lawmaker said according to a report by the semiofficial ilna news agency the death toll could have been much less if the hospital was not destroyed the citys old hospital some 30 years old did not suffer serious damage  karimi reported from tehran associated press writer jon gambrell in dubai united arab emirates contributed \n",

      " artificially cooling earth to counter global warming is a risky strategy new research has shown scientists have previously suggested that imitating volcanic eruptions to fire aerosols into the atmosphere would help to cool the planet down the aerosols one of many geoengineering techniques proposed as a way to deal with climate change  would cool earth by block incoming solar radiation but this could have a devastating effect on global regions prone to violent storms or prolonged dry spells new research has shown if aerosols are injected into the northern hemisphere they could cause severe droughts in africa while if they are injected in the southern hemisphere they could trigger a wave of tropical cyclones in northern regions of the globe scroll down for video in response the researchers from the university of exeter have called on policymakers worldwide to strictly regulate any largescale geoengineering programmes in the future they say this will prevent officials accidentally inducing natural disasters in different parts of the world dr anthony jones a climate science expert from the university of exeter and lead author on the paper said our results confirm that regional solar geoengineering is a highly risky strategy which could simultaneously benefit one region to the detriment of another it is vital that policymakers take solar geoengineering seriously and act swiftly to install effective regulation the innovative research centres on the impact solar geoengineering methods that inject aerosols into the atmosphere may have on the frequency of tropical cyclones the controversial approach known as stratospheric aerosol injection is designed to reflect some sunlight before it reaches earths surface the proposals mimic the aftermath of volcanic eruptions when aerosols are naturally injected into the atmosphere in the study the researchers use sophisticated simulations with a fully coupled atmosphereocean model to investigate the effect of hemispheric stratospheric aerosol injection on north atlantic tropical cyclone frequency the study suggests injections of aerosols in the northern hemisphere would reduce tropical cyclone activity responsible for  hurricane harvey and ophelia but the aerosols would at the same time lead to increased likelihood for drought in the sahel the area of subsaharan africa just south of the sahara desert the team found injections of aerosols  contained to the southern hemisphere may potentially enhance tropical cyclones in the north atlantic these results suggest the uncertain effects of solar geoengineering which should be considered by policymakers professor jim haywood from the mathematics department at the university of exeter and coauthor of the study added this research shows how a global temperature target such as 15 or 2c 27 or 36f needs to be combined with information on a more regional scale to properly assess the full range of climate impacts the research impacts of hemispheric solar geoengineering on tropical cyclone frequency is published in the journal nature communications afforestation  this technique would irrigate deserts such as those in australia and north africa to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide drawback  this vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space and so contribute to global warming artificial ocean upwelling engineers would use long pipes to pump cold nutrientrich water upward to cool oceansurface waters drawback  if this process ever stopped it could cause oceans to rebalance their heat levels and rapidly change the climate ocean alkalinisation this involves heaping lime into the ocean to chemically increase the absorption of carbon dioxide drawback study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures ocean iron fertilisation the method involves dumping iron into the oceans to improve the growth of photosynthetic organisms that can absorb carbon dioxide drawback study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures solar radiation management this would reduce the amount of sunlight earth receives by shooting reflective sulphatebased aerosols into the atmosphere drawback carbon dioxide would still build up in the atmosphere \n",

      " outside it was dark emily hunt could make out the familiar orange glint of street lights through the curtains but whose curtains where was she next to her on the bed was a man she didnt recognise sitting fully clothed with a tv remote in his hand casually flipping through the channels by now she realised she was in a hotel room she also realised she was naked but how shed got there and what had happened to her was a complete blank although she could probably hazard a guess a sordid nightmarish scene waking up with a thumping head and a complete stranger  most would gather their clothes and dash off sheepishly into the night vowing never to touch a drop again only this wasnt like that at all emily is a 38yearold highly intelligent divorcee with a sevenyearold daughter getting paralytic and picking up random strangers for sex is not something she does she hadnt been out partying that day shed enjoyed a very convivial lunch with her father who was visiting from ireland for a few days at their favourite restaurant in london her last conscious memory was finishing her meal at around 5pm it was now shortly after 10pm what on earth had happened there was literally no memory there its like id been picked up and dropped next to this guy on the bed she says i had never seen him in my life i was very cold and felt weird  kind of fuzzy but it wasnt a hangover then i kind of realised in this lightbulb moment that i must have been drugged i got really scared this week emily who works in london launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise £100000 to bring her alleged rapist to justice in a private prosecution after the cps refused to take up the case so far she has made £20000 its a case that has made headlines across the world with watercooler theorists debating everything from her morals to her judgment the parallels between the recent itv drama liar in which a teacher tried to prove that she had been drugged and raped were all too apparent yet emily a business strategy consultant who has worked for ibm remains unswayed she is neither an hysteric nor a sexual ingenue she insists while freely admitting to the odd brief illadvised sexual encounter with men in the past she says she would no more make a false allegation of rape than hack off her glorious thick red hair that terrible event twoandahalf years ago was different she says and it is for that reason that she is resolute in her determination to bring him to court so what did happen that day in may 2015 emily has made it her mission to find out as much as possible its a quest that has driven her to a mental breakdown shes also been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and continues to see a psychiatrist to this day emily whos originally from new york had moved to london 12 years ago after falling in love with her former husband the couple had divorced earlier in 2015 leaving their daughter with him shed met her own father for lunch that sunday at his favourite restaurant in bethnal green a stones throw from her east london home my dad had been staying with me for the weekend sunday lunch at that restaurant is one of our traditions they can last up to nine hours but dad was catching his flight home and i was supposed to be going on a date that evening with a guy whos a lawyer for a bank they ordered a bottle of pinot grigio and sat down to eat emily chose steak so asked for a glass of red wine while her father finished the white they ended the meal with a glass of grappa  an italian brandy  each the bar was crowded as its a popular place on a sunday says emily the grappas sat on the bar for a while before the waiter brought them to our table ive wondered if thats when the drink was spiked because my dad was late for his flight so left me to finish a third grappa we were sharing he doesnt even remember how he got to the airport or boarding the plane hed had to drop by emilys house to pick up his bags where her exhusband was looking after their little girl and he remarked how uncharacteristically drunk hed seemed my last memory is being in the restaurant alone says emily the next thing i knew was waking up naked on a bed with a man he was average looking literally that guy in the bar you dont notice emily has since learnt that she was captured on cctv that evening leaving a bar called poison less than a mile from the restaurant and the hotel with her alleged rapist the cctv footage shows me swaying with my arms all over him she says at various points im not able to hold myself up im falling over onto a bench ive had moments before on big nights out when things get a bit fuzzy but i always remember the embarrassing stuff but this time theres nothing in my memory from being at the table in the restaurant to waking up next to this guy emily now knows her alleged rapist took her to the town hall hotel in east london where he booked a £300anight room the cctv footage in the hotel foyer shows her to be all over her companion so much so that she knows its one of the reasons the cps took the decision not to prosecute when i finally came to i asked him where i was he told me then he asked me if i knew what his name was i was embarrassed i hadnt quite figured out what was happening i hadnt hit scared yet by then i was starting to piece it together thats when i thought i must have been drugged then i got scared emily gathered her clothes and went to the bathroom where she called one of her closest friends i said theres something really wrong i dont know who this guy is and i dont feel safe my friend said that hed call the police ten minutes later her friend texted to tell emily the police were on their way the guy tried to smooth everything over says emily he said dont worry nothing happened you just had a little too much to drink he didnt want me to go i remember thinking ive got to smile sweetly and get out of here she took his phone number and surname to make him feel ok and managed to reach the door as she shut it behind her her phone rang it was the police i ran down the stairs and fell into some police persons arms i was at that point terrified and freaking out they took me outside and i collapsed on the grass i was hyperventilating i couldnt catch my breath i thought i was going to die the police called an ambulance and paramedics did a blood test that revealed her blood sugar levels were so low she was suffering from hypoglycemia they fed her chocolate and took her to the royal london hospital i read afterwards that two causes of hypoglycemia can be alcohol poisoning and ghb the date rape drug but the police didnt give me a urine test until shortly before 2am and the fact my blood sugar levels were so low i had to be forcefed chocolate wasnt used by the cps in its decision making doctors fearing emily had suffered a heart attack gave her a scan and two paracetamol at 3am following a second urine test she was discharged from hospital and taken home police decided not to arrange a forensic examination as they deemed her too drunk to consent to it and an officer from the sapphire rape and sexual assault unit arranged to come to see her the following day there were two of them they sat in my front room and were horrible really horrible they were saying id had too much to drink and that these things happen i was feeling utterly terrified i kept saying i needed emotional support i need to speak to someone one of my friends came over and threw them out by 5pm having heard nothing she gave up i went and showered i was thinking hopefully hes telling the truth nothing happened and everything will be fine i had this sense of washing it all away the following morning emily was at the us embassy with her daughter and exhusband renewing their daughters passport when she received a phone call from the police the policewoman said in a totally cavalier way that the guy had admitted to sex but said it was consensual i was like what youve just confirmed my worst fear i need to be treated she said i dont think youve got anything to worry about we found used condoms in the room i began shouting at her i was utterly freaked out there i was standing in the us embassy with no privacy being told by a stranger who didnt seem to care at all that id been raped emily went to boots bought herself the morningafter pill and called the hospital they told her to come straight in and referred her to an hiv unit can you imagine what its like to not know what happened to your own body and to have this horrible feeling that someone else knows in fact quite a few people knew but i didnt have the information it was just horrible emily confesses it took her a long time to tell her dad what had happened to her that night the case was passed to the cps however in july 2015 the toxicology tests revealed there was no trace of drugs in her system more confusingly though the report also stated her alcohol level at the time of the alleged rape would have been about twice the legal drinkdrive limit which was not high enough to proceed with a straightforward alcoholrelated consent case it made no sense how could i have appeared so drunk that the police said i was too intoxicated to give consent for a forensic medical examination but only have that much alcohol in my body if i hadnt been drugged and wasnt completely trashed why did i have no memory of five hours of my life at that point i started googling ghb i discovered that instead of remaining in the body for 12 hours as the metropolitan police insist it can be broken down in as little as six hours what was really heartbreaking was when i discovered a hair test would have shown traces of gbh until midjune but we didnt get the results of the toxicology report until the end of july emily was on the bus commuting to work when she received what she says was a crassly insensitive email from the mets specialist sexual offences unit informing her the case against her alleged rapist had been dropped the email ended im sorry it is not the answer you wanted i felt the world closing in around me says emily it never occurred to me they wouldnt prosecute how could they not i was on a bus in central london when i opened the email i couldnt believe i lived in a world where what had happened to me wasnt prosecutable thats when i began to fall apart but she refused to let it drop last year the metropolitan police finally furnished her with the details of her case after she filed for access to information when she read its contents she suffered a complete and total breakdown so much so she was admitted to hospital for eight days for not only did emily learn that the 35yearold stranger shed woken up beside had been in possession of viagra and lsd when he was arrested but that he had filmed her naked on his phone for more than a minute while she was unconscious he told the police the video was for his own sordid gratification afterwards furthermore he had not consumed a drop of alcohol i suppose there was always a part of me that thought maybe i did get completely trashed and cant remember perhaps we were both two drunk people making a bad decision so to read that hed had no alcohol whatsoever    she breathes deeply and shakes her head worse was to come a copy of the toxicology report also revealed that tests that hadnt found any suspicious drugs in her system were based she believes upon wrong timings it was that which sent me over the edge she says according to the report my last memory was at 7pm but everything was a complete blank from between 4pm and 5pm when i finished lunch with my dad ghb takes between six to 12 hours for most people to break down the police didnt take a urine sample from me until nearly 2am so the wrong timeline made all the difference it meant instead of it being impossible that id been drugged my body could have eliminated the ghb particularly as i have a very fast metabolism reading that report was like being punched in the stomach i wasnt eating at all and couldnt cope with anything she says i knew this guy should be in jail but had thought if they didnt have the evidence to convict him id have to come to terms with that to actually discover they had so much evidence    she bites her lip in november last year following a meeting with the cps after a failed appeal emily resolved to fund a private prosecution three weeks ago she stood in front of 50 people at a public speaking event in london and waived her anonymity to share her story the support was overwhelming she knows who her assailant is and where he lives but has been advised not to reveal it i went home and set up a facebook page she says i wrote some of you know this story and some of you dont but twoandahalf years ago i was drugged and raped by a stranger its the beginning of the story but watch this space i tagged it metoo but do i believe her would i sitting on a jury and presented with all the evidence consider this man not guilty after all as emily says so theyve got a man who has admitted he gets turned on by unconscious women whos been found with viagra stonecold sober filming a woman who for whatever reason is so out of it shes unconscious on the bed and youre telling me theres not a reasonable chance a jury might find him guilty of rape i must admit i think she has a point visit emilys fundraising page at

      " trump finds success in asia screamed the cnn headline wait what every part of that sentence is bordering on unprecedented first donald trump being called a success during his tenure as president of the united states by someone other than himself or his white house staff second cnn his most entrenched mainstream media enemy being the ones to say it yet what else could my old network say by any yardstick trumps 12day tour to japan south korea china vietnam and the philippines has been a resounding triumph the main purpose of such a trip for any us president is to shore up relations with the countries you are visiting and their leaders and to represent america in a good positive way trump did all that and he did it with an ease confidence respect and good humour that often seems sorely lacking back home when hes strutting around the white house in what seems like perpetual rage he may be one of the most divisive presidents in history but in terms of his celebrity status already very big before he even ran for office trumps also a political superstar of almost unprecedented proportions hence the amazing scenes of excitement that have greeted him throughout the tour its been notable to see how much his numerous hosts have lavished him with extravagant praise and parades just as we saw on his previous visits to places like saudi arabia and france theyve worked out how to make trump happy treat him like the most powerful man in the world for a guy so widely reviled and scorned in his own country this high level of ostentatious respect must come as a blessed relief from the relentless hourbyhour war of attrition he wages at home with anyone and everyone from the media to grieving war widows on the first stop in japan prime minister abe played golf with trump and a top japanese professional star gave him customized hats saying donald  shinzo make alliance even greater and treated him to a steak dinner remembering trumps infamous claim during a trip to japan in 1990 that he did want fing raw fish there has never been such close bonds intimately connecting the leaders of both nations as we do now in the history of the japanus alliance said abe wow trump himself couldnt have outhyperboled that euphoric statement in south korea where trumps had a frosty relationship with president moon jaein he was met with thousands of flagwaving children military marching bands and hundreds of guards moon told his guest he was making great progress on making america great again he added there is a special bond forged between president trump and myself which is meaningful and i am grateful to be part of not to be outdone by abe he treated trump to grilled korean beef rib cooked with a 360yearold soy sauce next day trump was given 20 rousing ovations as he addressed south koreas national assembly chinese president xi saw all this and raised the bar tenfold unleashing the full armoury of chinese 7star hospitality and pageantry for the man who had spent his entire presidential campaign abusing and deriding china it included dinner inside the forbidden city where no foreign leader since 1949 has been invited to dine in return trump avoided attacking chinas human rights record and proudly showed xi a video of his granddaughter arabella speaking chinese i first heard arabella ivankas daughter do this on the set of celebrity apprentice when she was just two years old it was even more impressive then trump also praised china for outsmarting america in business they dont hear that very often and certainly not from us presidents but its true they have and trumps made it clear hes not going to make it so easy for them going forward knowing the chinese mentality a bit from filming a documentary in shanghai a few years ago id say this a very good strategy they respond well to a respectful carrotandstick approach as indeed does trump staterun broadcaster cctv said after he left that trump has given china what china wants which is that respect on a global stage as the other preeminent nation thats a highly significant vote of confidence in the worlds new most important relationship in vietnam trump offered to mediate in the south china sea dispute and made encouraging noises about fair and reciprocal twoway trade deal both vitally important issues for vietnams prime minister nguyen xuan phuc throughout his tour trump avoided publicly criticizing any of his hosts for a man who delights in criticizing absolutely everyone this must have taken quite extraordinary selfcontrol but it paid off the press coverage from this trip both in the countries concerned and in the us is the best trumps enjoyed since becoming president the only time he strayed off message and sparked controversy was when he tweeted that kim jong un was short and fat despite ironically this being one of his most undeniably truthful public statements the us media were desperate to gotcha trump making a fool of himself during the tour witness their liplicking joy when they heard hed chucked a whole bowl of food into a pool full of rare koi fish in japan twitter blew up with a video clip displaying his apparently crass potentially murderous stupidity then a fuller tape emerged showing president abe had done the exact same thing a few seconds before the only people to make fools of themselves over this were the us media and it exposed the inherent weakness of their relationship with this president  they know that bad trump news sells better than good trump news and it warps their judgement as he flew home trump predictably declared his asia tour tremendously successful for once the claim was justified he landed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of new trade deals had important discussions over security issues like north korea and isis and got a chance to show off his world class schmoozing skills honed from decades travelling the world doing real estate deals on his last night equally controversial philippines president rodrigo duterte sang trump a love song after dinner in manila one of the verses was you are the light in my world a half of this heart is mine it would take a heart of granite not to smile at that footage nor to recognise that this moment typified the spirit of this whole trip one of reconciliation inclusion and mutual respect not one of scoring cheap political points which is trumps preferred option from his washington bunker even during the absurd mass crossedhands leaders handshake on sunday at the association of southeast asian nations summit in manila when trump at first looked completely clueless he soon got into with commendable enthusiasm and even looked like hes learned how to laugh at himself donald trump showed on this asia tour that he has it in him to be fun charming dignified onmessage selfaware and a proper statesman dare i say he was thoroughly presidential i should also point out his wife melania continues to be a very impressive first lady who rarely puts a foot wrong the question now is can he bring that same donald trump to the us domestic stage i hope both that he can and that his hysterical shrieking us enemies calm down a bit to meet him half way im not suggesting that i expect to see trumphaters singing him soppy love songs but i do think its time they reminded themselves that he is the president of the united states and that office commands more respect than many have been showing him just as the office demands the president also shows more respect than he has been affording to many fellow americans as the asia trip proves trump can be a very different far less aggressive and dislikeable beast if hes shown respect \n",

their daughters bedside at colchester hospital when she died as they were given false reassurance about her condition and had gone home to fetch belongings essexs assistant coroner jolanta mckenzie recording a narrative conclusion after a twoday hearing said iris had been listed for surgery at the evelina london childrens hospital but this was not undertaken and she was admitted to colchester hospital while in respiratory distress iriss condition was not identified by treating clinicians her condition worsened and she died there were failings in the care provided by colchester hospital said dr mckenzie iris whose family live in great braxted essex died on december 2 2016 her heart operation had been scheduled and cancelled three times in november 2016 at evelina london childrens hospital which is part of guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust the first cancellation was because iris had a viral infection and the risks of surgery were too high the second time was due to a lack of beds and the third attempt was also cancelled as another ill child was prioritised iris had a fourth surgery date of december 9 2016 a week after her death her parents had taken her home as they awaited this scheduled operation but took her to colchester hospital when she developed breathing problems on december 2 her condition deteriorated and she died as a result of her unrepaired heart defect  complete atrioventricular septal defect mrs day said that at colchester hospital they were given really quite false reassurance that iris was stable which had led them to go home to collect some belongings for iris she told the inquest they later received a call from the hospital informing them that iris had deteriorated and when they got back to the hospital they found her lifeless from a human point of view the impression weve got is we havent felt theres been a whole lot of compassion from staff mrs day said iris to them might have been another patient but she was absolutely our whole world to know that she was let down that we were wrongly reassured that because of that i wasnt able to be with my baby when she passed away or console her when she was inconsolable to know that in those final moments she would have been uncomfortable she would have been sad and she wouldnt have had her mummy or daddy there with her thats something i will never forgive them for  for taking that away from us she said she became pregnant by private ivf treatment and had been very excited about the different journey we would have with iris and her condition of downs syndrome insurance broker mr day said i genuinely feel the majority of nhs staff who came into contact with iris in her short life let her and her family down in the worst possible way he continued my advice to any parent with an ill child is to be that annoying squeaky wheel  as the only caring advocate of that child is the parent dr kalyaan devarajan a paediatric consultant at colchester hospital said an investigation identified a series of deficiencies in certain aspects of care resulting in iriss sad demise at colchester hospital these include a failure to contact the evelina hospital and a failure to recognise that iriss increasing heart rate was a significant deterioration mrs day said she became pregnant by private ivf treatment and she and husband ben were very excited about the different journey we would have with iris and her condition of downs syndrome she said that at colchester hospital they were given really quite false reassurance that iris was stable and were wrongly told that

is the parent mckenzie said cancelled operations due a lack of intensive care beds is sadly a feature of hospitals across the uk giving a narrative conclusion she said there were failings in the care provided by colchester there was a failure to recognise the deteriorating patient by nursing and medical staff and to undertake appropriate tests that being blood gases as per the patient plans a failure to escalate matters appropriately or to call for help a failure to escalate difficult in cannulation a failure to prioritise cannulation in a vulnerable patient and a failure to communicate with evelina the tertiary centre with a missed opportunity for potential transfer and a failure to call back the family at the right time when iriss condition deteriorated so they could be there to comfort their daughter we have heard from the expert that the impact of the missed opportunity on the outcome is impossible to say asked if they were considering further legal action against the nhs trust at the court steps hannah said we are in discussion for it ben day read from a statement saying the six months we had with iris showed my wife and i that in todays nhs the only true advocate for

wakefield under the purple covering by family and friends before marrying charles bronson after tying the knot she left under the same covers as she made her way to the reception without her new husband at the start of the day she was bundled into the back of a silverblue mercedes and driven over to the prison by official charles bronson lookalike timothy crowley for her wedding ceremony a mobility scooter driven by a woman dressed in a cream pinstripe suit led the wedding car procession just five people witnessed bronson saying i do in a behind closed doors ceremony at the west yorkshire prison which began at 2pm a black saab convertible car with the words free charles bronson emblazoned on the side was also parked outside the ceremony lasted around twoandahalf hours and the party is continuing at the york house hotel nearby with friends and family scroll down for video according to bronsons official lookalike timothy crowley who accompanied ms williamson to the wedding the actress lives and breaths for the prisoner paula lives and breaths prison hardman bronson according to his official lookalike mr crowley 49 says he was on a visit with the couple six weeks ago and he is under no illusions that bronson and paula are madly in love he has been corresponding with the prison hardman for four years and was due to attend the ceremony at hmp wakefield today but said prison staff reneged at the last minute saying they didnt receive the appropriate paperwork on time however mr crowley believes the prison decided against allowing him to attend because they dont want the publicity of milking charlie he said im in constant contact with paula she is a very nice girl and she has had a lot of cyberbullying and trolls saying she is in it for this that and the other which to be fair is very uncalled for i was in a visit with the two of them and you can quite see what she feels for charlie and the connection is there she works tirelessly on this case doing what she can to help him in any way shape or form are they in love im under no illusion to think anything different to be fair she lives and breaths him and vice versa the three of us when we sat in a room we have all been in dark places i think thats why we have a connection i was due to be in there whether they dont want the publicity of milking charlie or putting him in a good light on the outside they seem to think the paperwork didnt go through in time apparently they received it on short notice im told but we think there is an ulterior motive he charlie has told me different things about what is going to happen in the wedding and his words to me some time back my job for charlie is to portray him as a good guy on the outside timothy says he was introduced to the notorious prisoner through paula who spotted pictures of him dressed up like bronson on facebook he said the real bronson has asked him to carry on being his lookalike to portray him as a good guy on the outside mr crowley said i was doing this being a looklike for a good cause its through default i never went out there to be a charles bronson lookalike i purely did it for a good cause i grew it the mustache it was due to come off and then the photo was put on facebook and his fiance approached me and said i looked like charlie it just sprang from there really i didnt want to send the photos into him because he might have thought i was just taking the mickey he loves the photos and we are in pretty much constant contact people still see him as this villain but i truly believe he has served his time now and he deserves a break i write to charlie and he says to me portray me in a good light and get people to sign the petition i think the bottom line is he just wants a positive vibe out there about him the letters and pictures he sends me are all of a positive nature bronson he says is been and gone he says bronson was the loser and salvador is now the bornagain artist he gave up a shotgun and found a paintbrush he is embracing his art he has been a naughty boy we know his misdemeanours but he has gone 14 years over his tariff on the grand scheme of things there are so many people out there when you consider paedophiles terrorists and the like this man has had a very very raw deal indeed i think its high time to work towards getting him out there is definitely another side to him he has got a very big heart i feel for the man i truly do bronsons message is etched in capital letters on a sign swinging in the wind outside the hotel where his bridetobe is staying bronson who signs off the message says if you follow my footsteps youre following a madman so think he labels prison the funny farm and tells youngsters to say no to crime for your mum bronson talks of there being no glamour or achievements in a prison cell and refers to life behind bars as a crp existence the lengthy message reads in full what would i say to youngsters who are about to take the road to crime simple put the brakes on stop and think the facts are simple its a road to hell dont do it you can never get that time back its lost forever gone a waste of life imagine it for years decades try and work out the damage and pain it will have on your family life its actually horrific ill tell you what it does it destroys lives and turns people into heartless souls when youre young you think its clever it makes you feel tough youre with the boys doing your porridge big tough guys but your mothers at home crying her eyes out she has to save up every month to visit you in all weathers she has to be searched and security checked to get in to see you your mother is just another statistic of your crime spree shes a victim too imagine her visiting you for 20 to 30 years imagine the stress the worry the pain her sons throwing away his life it hurts her then she dies broken hearted and youre still in prison you werent there for her you never were you may be refused to attend her funeral then when its all over who visits you then if and when you get out you go to visit the grave what can you say this is only a small part of the prison world its cold cruel and wicked there is no glamour or achievements in a prison cell then you need to think about the violence the rapes the suicides the depression and the madness it all rubs off on you years and years of emptiness hopelessness being told when to eat when to get up when to go to the exercise yard when to shower being told when you can see when to sht when to sleep being controlled crp food crp clothes crp bedding and a crp life this is what comes with crime you may get a short sentence you may get a long one or you may get life whatever you get youve lost your life no birds no luxuries no sweet smells just a lot of porridge thats what youre looking at a boring existence soul destroying is crime worth it lets say you make £1 million and serve 10 years is it worth it 10 years of nothing believe me money cant buy a life and the truth is

those kids are grownups you lost out on a fatherhood you walk out of prison to a world that left you behind your hairs grey your eyes no longer shine youre a bitter old man thats your future thats if you make it out lots dont they die in prison they may get stabbed up they may die of stress bad diets and some turn to drugs its a crp existence do yourself a favour turn your back on it lifes so

collar felt and land in the big black pit of doom so many youngsters come into this world whinging and moaning poor me blaming the world human rights crp well welcome to the funny farm your straight jacket awaits ps do it for your mum say no to crime the 37yearold actress who has appeared in emmerdale and coronation street  last week said they were very excited about the ceremony and that bronson would be singing a surprise song for her she also revealed todays occasion will be the first time the convicted armed robber now known as charles salvador will wear zippedup trousers in 20 years  although he may not be allowed to attend his own reception according to the best man   despite the wedding plans having been agreed with prison chiefs salvadors best man rod harrison claimed this weekend that they had reneged on their word he said that salvador was told on friday that some arrangements concerning the wedding were being withdrawn writing on facebook on saturday mr harrison who is salvadors best man and will be attending the nuptials with five other guests this week said salvador was keeping calm and had not exploded in rage after being told the news mr harrison wrote update on the wedding  despite all the arrangements for the wedding being agreed three weeks ago the governor and prison have reneged on their word and late yesterday afternoon nov 10 informed charlie that some of the agreed arrangements were being withdrawn the wedding will still be a good day even if not what was promised there are other matters that i cant go into here that the prison system are trying it on with but charlie has not given them the reaction they expected and he is taking it in his stride he added the wedding will still be going ahead  it will be a fantastic day and a great evening  sadly to say charlie will not be at the reception or will he speaking last week miss williamson said he is going to sing another song but i dont know what it will be as its a surprise he salvador is very excited  it will be the first time hes worn zipped trousers in 20 years he is wearing a wedding suit and ill be in a white dress the rings they will exchange will have cps engraved on them  standing for charlie  paula salvador but which is also the acronym for the crown prosecution service miss williamson also revealed that after the ceremony she will head off to a local hotel with friends and family before jetting off to malta on her honeymoon she said he charlie told me to go on honeymoon without him so im going to malta with friends speaking previously miss williamson said that salvador was a changed man and had not been violent in three years she said he will not be in jail for the rest of his days  i will make sure personally he wont be in jail for the rest of his days i wont give up when i want something i always get it and i want him out and hes going to be out end of she added why would i be with a man who has been in jail for so long im in love with the man im not in love with the fact hes a prisoner behind every prisoner is a person hes done some things hes not proud of but he can only blame himself he blames noone else meanwhile she told lbc it was frustrating that she wasnt allowed conjugal visits with her 64yearold partner but said she was willing to wait she said he wants to be a father we havent had a physical relationship as conjugal visits arent allowed in britain  we would love it but it wont happen its not ideal you expect it a physical relationship when you get married but im willing to wait she said that salvador had not been violent in the past three years and was instead concentrating on his artwork she added we are not asking for him to be let out tomorrow just get him off segregation where he is now and allow him to progress through the system towards his release he has been a loose cannon in the past however in the past three years since he changed his name to charles salvador he has not committed a violent offence whatsoever his artwork has saved him its his salvation as hes locked up for 22 hours a day after passing a string of violence reductions courses in prison salvador  real name michael peterson  is now appealing against his life sentence salvador was first locked up for armed robbery in 1974 but during his time inside he has taken hostages in 10 prison sieges attacked at least 20 prison officers and caused £500000 in damage in rooftop protests in 1999 he was given a life sentence after taking prison art teacher phil danielson hostage at hmp hull after he criticised one of his drawings the parole board is set to make a decision on salvadors future within the next two weeks \n",

      " an antiques dealer has been found guilty of supplying guns and ammo to gangsters which were later used in several murders and over 100 shootings across britain paul edmunds 65 from hardwicke gloucestershire was dubbed the breaking bad of the gun world after he altered outofdate calibres to bring them back into use in an armoury in his garage they were supplied to dr mohinder surdhar 57 from handsworth birmingham who then sold them on to the criminal underworld the weapons and ammunition have been directly linked to crimes across nine police forces including murders attempted murders and the 2011 birmingham riots when shots were fired at the west midlands police helicopter the sole benefit for both men was money the prosecution proved at trial that edmunds had unexplained deposits of more than £350000 edmunds imported huge quantities of antique and other firearms from the usa over a sixyear period and was also responsible for manufacturing specialist ammunition to fit the handguns following his arrest officers discovered edmunds had also falsified entries in his firearms register and damaged tools which he had used to make the ammunition this was in an attempt to remove unique markings to frustrate later scientific examination surdhar pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and ammunitions edmunds was found guilty of conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and ammunitions two counts of perverting the course of justice transferring prohibited weapons possession of prohibited weapons and importing firearms from america he pleaded guilty to exporting ammunition both men will be sentenced at a later date referring to the two defendants detective constable phil rodgers from west midlands police said they were like the breaking bad of the gun world  on the face of it both decent men but using their skills and expertise to provide deadly firearms but this was no tv drama  these were real weapons real bullets real victims their actions have had a devastating impact on communities by fuelling violent crime leading to fear and bloodshed edmunds has an encyclopaedic knowledge of firearms its not an easy task making obsolete calibre bullets to fit antique guns it would have taken several days to make a box of 50 surdhar also had an armoury at his home and we believe edmunds was teaching him the art of bullet making our investigation has undoubtedly prevented many more firearms and countless rounds of ammunition getting into criminal hands and in all likelihood saved lives warren stanier from the cps said these two men used their expertise to exploit the illicit firearms market for financial gain and in doing so put the lives of the general public and police in danger the cps built a compelling case against the defendants using expert evidence provided by the national ballistics intelligence service and the west midlands regional organised crime unit we work with colleagues in the criminal justice system to identify and robustly pursue those involved throughout the supply chain for illegal firearms the removal of edmunds and surdhar from that supply chain has reduced criminals opportunity to source firearms and use them in further serious crimes in october edmunds went on trial accused of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition at birmingham crown court he denied fraudulent evasion of a prohibition or restriction perverting the course of justice and possession of a prohibited firearm a jury of seven men and five women was told that edmunds created the ammo for antique weapons from three armouries at his home he was investigated after the national ballistics intelligence service nabis noticed an increasing number of prewar handguns at crime scenes nabis managed to arrest and convict an organised crime gang involved in supplying the firearms with the speciallymade ammunition experts realised tool markings on the ammunition matched those they had recovered over several years and collated as operation gold dust opening the case prosecutor andrew fisher qc said this case concerns the supply of guns and live ammunition to criminal gangs both in the west midlands and across the country in march 2014 the police mounted an operation in an attempt to apprehend both those who supplied the guns and those who possessed them the firearms experts at nabis had noticed that since 2009 an increasing number of police recoveries were of prewar handguns for which there was no commercially available ammunition most of these recoveries were specially made ammunition for these guns and examinations showed that much of this ammunition had been manufactured using the same equipment microscopic examinations enabled them to see telltale tool markings on the ammunition rather like fingerprints which all matched therefore it appeared that the same person or manufacturer was supplying the specially made or adapted ammunition that was recovered from over 100 crime scenes throughout the country as you can imagine there was an extensive search for not just the people who had these firearms but the person supplying them and the ammunition operation cookie was launched in 2014 and since then a number of people have been arrested and have been convicted the court heard how the weapons had been passed to gang leader nosakhere stephenson through middleman mohinder surdhar who liaised with chief armourer sundish nazran mr fisher added it is now clear that mohinder surdhar was supplying to the organised crime group that i have just told you about however dr surdhars dealings were exclusively with the gangs chief armourer sundish nazran surdhar obtained the guns from various sources including mr edmunds and the specially made or adapted ammunition from edmunds these weapons were then used in several fatal shootings and the shooting at a police helicopter during the london riots of 2011 initially mr edmunds was approached by the police them having found an invoice of his amongst surdhars papers as you can imagine his premises were then searched it was found that he had made numerous false entries into his register to cover his tracks and many of the firearms were not listed his business was run from home the principal armoury was his garage and this was already known to and regularly inspected by the authorities but police searches found a further armoury in his bedroom where he undertook some of the modifications and a third one in the attic it was found that the specially made or adapted ammunition recovered by the police in the 100 plus recoveries from crime scenes matched ammunition found at edmunds house there were many tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and component parts it was found that he had a recipe book which tells him what the main ingredients are for any calibre of ammunition that he wants to make plainly he has an expertise and almost encyclopaedic knowledge of firearms and ammunition he has been supplying guns and ammunition highly unlawfully for many years jurors were told how further searches of edmunds home revealed he had been importing hundreds of guns from the united states paying around £250000 mr fisher said he then failed to list them on his firearms register meaning they could not be traced he added he managed to get round this regulation including costs and taxes in order to make it cheaper for him but more relevantly easier to supply to the illicit market on examination of his registers it became clear that of the hundreds of guns he had imported very few had been recorded in his register these guns and ammunition were not found on his property meaning that they must have been sold the failure to mark them in his stock record made it easier for him to supply them to the illicit market no record no trace these guns together with the ammunition have inevitably gone almost directly into the hands of dangerous criminals since they could not in reality be lawfully held by anyone other than the firearms dealer the court also heard edmunds may have made up to £375000 as a result of selling on the guns and ammo mr fisher said it was also found that £300000 was paid into his many card accounts under the heading credit and £75000 was paid into other accounts again through cash it would appear that unknown sources have funded mr edmunds activities to the tune of £375000 this may reflect some of his criminal activity in supplying firearms and ammunition illicitly to people who should not and are not permitted to have them

      " roy moore and his wife kayla teamed up on monday to dispute the claims of his latest accuser and take aim at her lawyer i can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false i never did what she said i did i dont even know the woman moore told abc 33 on monday night with his wife by his side i dont know anything about her i dont even know where the restaurant is or was moore then added that the claim he attempted to rape a then16yearold beverly young nelson was a political maneuver which had nothing to do with reality back in washington dc on tuesday speaker of the house paul ryan joined his senate counterpart mitch mcconnell and said that moores accusers seemed credible and the senate hopeful should step down scroll down for videos kayla also chimed in at the last second news conference to say that he husband had never one time lifted a finger against me in their 32 years of marriage these things are false and its ugly its the ugliest politics ive ever been in in my life said kayla she made that statement just hours after she stated beverlys lawyer gloria allred was on a quest to advance transgender rights by representing the victim in a facebook post her husbands campaign went a step further by stating allred was on a witch hunt and responsible for the murder of millions of babies  gloria allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt and she is only around to create a spectacle said a statement on released by the moore campaign on monday allred was the attorney who claims credit for giving us roe v wade which has resulted in the murder of tens of millions of unborn babies kayla meanwhile wrote a lengthy post defending her husband we knew something was coming just did not know what next this is the same gloria allred that did the very exact same thing to trump during his campaign wrote kayla going on two months now theyve been on a witchhunt here in etowah county and our state advertising people to step forward with accusations and we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward which is part of why we are filing suit kayla then said washington establishment and democrat party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign she closed out by telling her followers prayers appreciated a few hours later she posted a photo of allred in a parade holding a sign that read i support transgender equality and wrote gloria allred what its really about this comes after kayla posted a letter from 50 pastors showing their support for moore over the weekend without noting that it was obtained in august leading two of the individuals who signed to come forward and demand that their names be removed beverly said in an emotional press conference on monday that she first met moore when he was district attorney and she was a high school student who was waiting tables at the olde hickory house she was just 15 at the time and soon after she turned 16 moore then 31 offered beverly a ride home one cold winter night she said which was the night of the alleged incident beverly said that after getting in the car moore drove her to the back of the parking lot and pulled up next to a dumpster where he parked and then began to grope beverlys breasts she said that she asked him to stop and that when she tried to get out of the vehicle he locked the door and grabbed her neck in an attempt to pull her head down towards his crotch moore abruptly called a news conference in gallant alabama after a tearful beverly young nelsons detailed the new allegations to reporters in new york i can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false i never did what she said i did i dont even know the woman moore said  even though he allegedly signed her yearbook i got into his car in the passenger seat he began driving i thought he would get on the highway but instead he drove to the back of the restaurant said beverly of the night she was allegedly assaulted by moore i was not immediately alarmed as there was an exit from the back of the restaurant to the street and he could drive from there to my house without getting on the highway however instead of driving to the street he stopped the car and parked his car in between the dumpster and the back of the restaurant where there were no lights the area was dark and deserted i was alarmed and i immediately asked him what he was doing moore at that point said nothing and began to grope beverly she claimed a story she previously shared with her mother and then man who is now her husband instead of answering my question mr moore reached over and began groping me putting his hands on my breasts said beverly i tried to open my car door to leave but he reached over and locked it so i could not get out i tried fighting him off while yelling at him to stop but instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch i continued to struggle i was determined that i was not allow him to force me to have sex with him i was terrified he was also trying to pull my shirt off i thought that he was going to rape me i was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop i had tears running down my face beverly was able to get out of the car soon after claiming moore told her to keep quiet because no one would believe her if she did share her story he said youre just a child and he said i am the district attorney of etowah county and if you tell anyone about this no one will ever believe you her boyfriend who was initially supposed to pick her up but had been running late pulled up to the restaurant soon after beverly made her way out of the vehicle i did not say anything to him as to what had occurred as he had a violent temper and i was afraid that he would do something that would get him into trouble when i got home i went to my room explained beverly the following morning my neck was black and blue and purple in the days following i covered the bruising on my neck with makeup i did not tell anyone about what had happened i was scared she then added i felt that if i told anyone mr moore would do something to me or my family i decided to keep what happened to myself and she also found a way to avoid moore the day after mr moore assaulted me i called the restaurant and quit my job i never went there again said beverly then shortly after she began sharing her story about two years later i told my younger sister what mr moore did to me said beverly about four years ago i told my mother what happened before i married my husband john i told him what mr moore had done to me her attorney gloria allred said at the top of the press conference that beverly would be willing to testify under oath in front of the us senate ahead of moore possibly joining their ranks we urge the united states senate judiciary committee to hold a public hearing as soon as possible said allred beverly is willing to voluntarily appear at such a hearing to testify under oath she is willing to answer any questions that the senators might ask her relevant to her allegations against mr moore and after a number of accusers were shredded apart because of their political affiliations beverly very plainly stated that both she and her husband were supporters of president donald trump in the last election allred also dismissed claims that she might be politically motivated in her decision to represent beverly i would point out that i did not contact beverly she contacted me further i have a public record of attacking democrats who are or have been elected officials when they have been accused of injustices against women said allred before beverly shared her story for example i filed a lawsuit against democratic mayor bob filner of san diego and publicly accused him of sexually harassing the citys communications director as a result of the mediation of our lawsuit mayor filner resigned as mayor she also pointed out that she publicly criticized both anthony weiner and bill clinton in the past this latest accuser proved to be the most damaging yet however and soon after her press conference senator john cornyn of texas withdrew his support of moore calling the allegations damaging and disqualifying if in fact true this came after a devastating statement from the highestranking republican in the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was blunt and to the point with his assessment even before the press conference on monday stating i believe the women he went on to tell reporters that moore should step aside which led to moore responding with a vitriolic post on social media the person who should step aside is mitch mcconnell he has failed conservatives and must be replaced draintheswamp said moore maine senator susan collins also weighed in and once again proved she had no issue bucking her partys trend i have now read mr moores statement and listened to his radio interview in which he denies the charges she wrote on twitter i did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the senate race in alabama it remains to be seen if beverly will be called to testify but she thanked those four women who came before her during her press conference on monday revealing that they gave her the greatest gift i thought that i was mr moores only victim i would probably have taken what mr moore did to me to my grave had it not been for the courage of four other women that were willing to speak out about their experiences with mr moore explained beverly while drying her eyes with a tissue their courage has inspired me to overcome my fear one woman told the washington post that moore initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was 32 three others said moore pursued them when they were 18 or younger an emotionally exhausted beverly managed to summarize the entire incident in a few lines to close out the conference mr moore attacked me when i was a child i did nothing to deserve his sexual attack said beverly i was frightened by his position and his power i am coming forward to let mr moore know that he no longer has any power over me and i no longer live in fear of him \n",

      " michele lent hirsch was 16 when the twin towers fell on september 11 2001 four blocks from her high school in downtown manhattan  she can remember seeing the first tower fall from her window at 959am then feeling the whole building shake when the second tower fell 29 minutes later as she and her classmates huddled in a stairwell even now accessing those traumatic memories is painful but ptsd is not the only thing michele and her classmates were left with in 2010 at the age of 25 michele was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer  which is typically caused by radiation exposure and the federal government has officially recognized that it was caused by 911 michele now 32 is one of many children and residents of battery park the financial district and tribeca who are not often thought of as the classic candidates for 911related diseases with most coverage focused on first responders and the people who worked in the offices but while she does fall into that bracket she did not know she was eligible for federallyfunded cancer treatment until she was almost in remission  and she claims she is hardly the only one i went through all of my cancer treatment and i didnt know that i could access federally funded care until very late in the game michele told daily mail online i had my thyroid removed in an incredibly painful surgery and i had radioactive iodine treatment in 2011 which was unspeakably bad i luckily had insurance through a good job but i found out later through a friend from high school that i was eligible for mount sinais world trade center healthcare program which funds treatment for 911related illnesses i had thought that only first responders had access to things like that there are tons of students and teachers and people who lived and worked downtown who should know that they are eligible michele is sharing her story as dozens of children teachers and bereaved families from various schools around ground zero file claims against the city for failing to protect them from cancerous toxins then failing to provide wellpublicized support rates of papillary thyroid cancer increased about 10 percent in communities in the wake of the atomic bombs in japan and after chernobyl now researchers are seeing the same in new yorks socalled cancer cluster micheles cancer was symptomless she went for her annual primary care checkup when she was 25 and her doctor who had recently seen another patient diagnosed with thyroid cancer decided to feel her neck she said oh theres a lump which is something you never want to hear eventually it was confirmed that i had several tumors michele recalled mine had spread to my lymph nodes so it was a more aggressive variation than the doctors would have liked to see while thyroid cancer is more common in white females than any other demographic it typically affects people in their 40s and older the average fiveyear survival rate is 90 percent for all forms of thyroid cancer and can be closer to 100 percent for young sufferers since it is slowgrowing however the treatments to beat the disease and prevent it spreading to the lungs or brain or liver are grueling michele underwent a heavyduty operation in 2011 at the age of 26 to remove her thyroid a butterflyshaped gland at the base of the voice box which is essential for hormone regulation metabolism and body heat the operation takes at least two hours under general anesthesia carefully extracting the gland from the nerves and vessels patients then require two days of supervision in hospital and will need thyroid replacement drugs for life to ensure all the cancer cells are blitzed most patients  especially those whose cancer has spread  are advised to get radioactive iodine treatment the procedure involves ingesting a radioactive form of iodine iodine 131 which sweeps through the body the cancerinfected thyroid cells consume the iodine which kills them essentially it turns the patient radioactive for a few days and they remain in quarantine throughout it was horrible michele says already feeling alone as a 20something with cancer the isolation and fear took a severe emotional toll now six years later michele is in remission though she adds that its very nervewracking every single time she gets a checkup and her care is paid for by the federallyfunded program getting enrolled she was also surprised to find she could get free therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder i really needed it we all need it but i hadnt really thought about it until they offered it to me she says its one of the most traumatizing things that i have ever been through its hard to talk about everyone at my school was traumatized by what happened i had definitely not dealt with it until they had given me that free therapy officially the world trade center health registry recognizes 70 cancers as being linked to the toxic cocktail of fumes from ground zero including pulverized concrete jet fuel and mercury it also recognizes gerd every lung disease sleep apnea sinusitis depression asthma and ptsd mark farfel director of the world trade center health registry estimates around 400000 responders and civilians are at risk of 911related illnesses as of last year mount sinais world trade center health program had counted more than 5400 people with 911related cancers alone not counting the other illnesses but michael barasch a lawyer representing more than a dozen former students insists the city did not do enough to protect and treat his clients announcing his cases last week he said a 28yearold girl should have not breast cancer a 29yearold boy should not have colon cancer or bladder cancer michele who is not currently represented by barasch agrees i do know that various parents were debating whether it was safe for us to go back to school and we were worried about it too but the school said to come back so we did she recalls the smell i can remember the smell very strongly it had a very strong noxious odor that smelled like bad chemical and i do remember it making me very concerned but when youre 16  or even some kids were 13 or 14  you dont have agency you have to go to school if you want to graduate from that school with good grades and have a chance of going to college so if they say its time to go to school you go obviously now we know that was probably the wrong decision but as high school students we were not adults we were not in charge of our own decisions \n",

      " donald trump headed home from the philippines on tuesday bringing with him the promise of hundreds of billions of dollars in promised trade deals and a host of expanded controversies the president said he had a tremendously successful trip and that tremendous amounts of work was done on trade as he departed manila earlier than expected they will be treating us much differently than they have in the past trump said to reporters returning with him to the us on air force one countries were taking advantage of the united states more than just this region but the world and those days are over trump skipped a group photo at the east asia summit that was running behind schedule and delivered remarks at a luncheon instead of the main stage so he could hightail it back to the united states hes making his way back to washington by way of hawaii scroll down for videos  his 12day swing through the far east was the longest such journey by a us president in 25 years lasting longer than the tenure of his colorful former communications director anthony scaramucci it ended tuesday with a stop at the east asia summit his second international gathering in manila and a liftoff aboard air force one at 318 pm local time before jumping on a helicopter to the manila airport trump stopped to congratulate reporters for keeping up with him my press i feel so sorry for them theyre exhausted he said would you like to stop at another couple of countries because we can do that if you want otherwise well go to the plane and well take off and well be landing in washington in about 22 hours he said there are at least $300 billion worth of deals pending with us companies selling into nations he visited and predicted the us would see triple that number in a fairly short period of time on the return flight trump amplified the boom in business even more telling reporters he believes that number is going to be quadrupled very quickly vietnam is ordering at least $12 billion worth of boeings he said and i think they were going a different route but now theyre going the route of ordering from us trump patted himself on the back for cultivating a us relationship with the philippines that is probably better than ever before something he said was crucial because of military bases there that the us uses to house troops and store war materiel the philippines is an unbelievably important military location because if you speak to the admirals and you speak to the generals thats a perfect spot trump said and as you know we had no relationship for a long period of time in the philippines and now we have a very good relationship there trump boasted monday that he had seed red carpet like nobody i think has probably ever received and that really is a sign of respect  perhaps for me a little bit but really for our country and im very proud of that the way theyve treated us  the respect that japan and china and south korea in particular because we went there  have treated us has been really a great respect for the people of our country the people of the united states he said he asserted later that his diplomacy had unified nations in the region against the north korean nuclear threat i think their acts are all together china has been excellent japan and south korea have been excellent i think thats a very important part of the trip trump said during his tour of the far east he dangled the threat of allout war against north korea toured beijings forbidden city golfed with the japanese prime minister and quizzed russian president vladimir putin on his alleged 2016 us election meddling trump also held his first oneonone meeting with philippines president rodrigo duterte and let him off the hook without pressing him on the hot topic of human rights abuses linked to his bloody drug war the white house has promised to brief the nation this week about sales of military equipment and other goods meant to chip away at americas massive trade deficits with china and other asian nations i will be making a major statement from the whitehouse upon my return to dc time and date to be set the president tweeted before heading to the manila airport he said in a statement to the press before take off i think the fruits of our labor are going to be incredible whether its the security of our nations whether its security of the world or whether its trade and its going to really amount to a lot air force one will make a refueling stop in hawaii before it delivers trump to maryland where hell make a brief helicopter ride aboard marine one back to the white house the trip he tweeted tuesday will lead to fair trade deals unlike the horror shows from past administrations after my tour of asia all countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed the united states has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion the massive trade deficits must go down quickly he wrote in a second tweet he said tuesday on his first of two flights back to the us that his press statement would go into greater detail of what was accomplished during the trip that kept him out of washington for nearly half the month i think one of the things we really accomplished big is relationship and also letting people know that from now on things are going to be reciprocal we cant have trade deficits of $30 $40 $50 billion $300 billion in the case of china trump said we cant do that we have to have reciprocal trade whats good for them is good for us trump told chinese president xi jinping in beijing that he doesnt blame him for maintaining a $347 billion trade advantage last year it was past administrations that allowed the economic relationship between the two countries to get so far out of kilter he said xi spelled out a friendly us policy that trump did not disagree with saying that the pacific ocean is big enough to accommodate both china and the united states during a ceremony marking what the white house said was $250 billion in new sales agreements for boeing general electric qualcomm and other american companies trump said who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens i give china great credit trumps hot and cold relationship with xis government had heads spinning hours after leaving china trump was singing a different tune telling a vietnamese audience that he will not let the united states be taken advantage of anymore on trade trump cautiously avoided pointing fingers at xi by name but condemned chinalike chronic trade abuses that ignore world trade organization rules and harm us businesses and workers we must ensure that all play by the rules which they do not right now he said those who do will be our closest economic partners those who do not can be certain that the united states will no longer turn a blind eye to violations cheating or economic aggression those days are over the evening before trump charmed the chinese at a gala in his honor by playing a video of his granddaughter arabella singing and reciting stories in mandarin hello grandpa xi hello grandma peng arabella said introducing her 2minute performance the chinese president said the young girl deserved an a+ trump called xi a friend several times on the trip but denied tuesday that they were close when a reporter asked about the risk trump is taking in buddying up with the authoritarian leader well relationship is always important it doesnt mean its necessarily close its really a relationship based on respect to me a relationship based on respect is much more important than anything else including friendship trump stated they have to respect our country and they have not respected our country for a long period of time in closeddoor remarks at the east asia summit before he left asia trump reportedly checked beijings efforts to take over the south china sea a paper transcript of the presidents speech at a luncheon that he himself provided to reporters claims he said ensuring regional security will also require all nations to respect freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea i remain concerned about chinas efforts to build and militarize outposts in the south china sea the united states supports the peaceful resolution of all territorial disputes when trump addresses the nation this week the united states trade relationships will be a focal point but he will also spell out where his administration stands on defanging north korean dictator kim jongun whose nuclear missile ambitions occupied much of the commanderinchiefs attention last week he told reporters as he left manila that his speech would happen maybe wednesday afternoon or maybe thursday morning trump said last wednesday in south korea that the sinister regime to the north had become a dangerous menace and warned kim not to test his patience today i hope i speak not only for our countries but for all civilized nations when i say to the north do not underestimate us and do not try us addressing a global audience during a speech to south koreas national assembly he insisted that the world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation the north korean government fired back saying trump had showed hes itching for allout armageddon on the korean peninsula trump during his visit laid bare his true nature as destroyer of world peace and stability and begged for a nuclear war on the korean peninsula the hermit nations foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the state news agency trump made his conceived attempt yet again to alienate our people from the government he said kims regime also called trump an old lunatic setting off the 71yearold president who had refrained most of the trip from tweeting about the 33yearold despot why would kim jongun insult me by calling me old when i would never call him short and fat oh well i try so hard to be his friend  and maybe someday that will happen  trump tweeted he said later during a news conference that he was serious about becoming kims friend one day strange things happen in life that might be a strange thing to happen but its certainly a possibility trump said in hanoi vietnam the president attempted to make a surprise visit to the korean demilitarized zone during a oneday stop in south korea early on in his triop but his helicopters landing was aborted because of peasoup fog in japan he played a round of golf with prime minister shinzo abe and fed fish with him in a koi pond during a visit to emperor akihito trump managed to avoid a repeat of a widely mocked episode eight years ago in which thenpresident barack obama bowed deeply before him during his twocity stop in vietnam trump made news by appearing to side with putin over american intelligence agencies on the politically fraught question of the russian governments alleged meddling in the election that vaulted trump to power in a brief conversation on the sidelines of an economic summit in da nang putin flatly denied it all he said he didnt meddle he said he didnt meddle i asked him again you can only ask so many times trump told reporters aboard air force one i just asked him again he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election he did not do what they are saying he did i really believe that when he tells me that he means it trump said hours later during a press conference in hanoi trump insisted that he is with the cia nsa fbi and director of national intelligence and doesnt buy putins denials what he believes is what he believes what i believe is that we have to get to work trump said we have to get to work to solve syria to solve north korea to solve ukraine to solve terrorism im surprised that theres any conflict on this a frustrated trump said what i said there is that i believe he believes that  and thats very important for somebody to believe i believe that he feels that he and russia did not meddle in the election as to whether i believe it or not he continued im with our agencies especially as currently constituted with their leadership i believe in our intel agencies our intelligence agencies ive worked with them very strongly trump had called questions about his campaigns alleged collusion with moscow an artificial democratic hit job that gets in the way of international diplomacy he said people will die because of it as tense usrussia relations make it more difficult to cajole putin into helping derail north koreas rapidly accelerating nuclear program i call it the artificial democrat barrier it gets in the way which is a shame he said trump and putin shook hands publicly three times during the asiapacific economic cooperation summit in da nang the first such moment came when the men were wearing matching blue silk shirts picked by the vietnamese government to mark the occasion past years have seen presidents and prime ministers cajoled into donning chilean ponchos indonesian batik shirts and chinese jackets that looked like star trek uniforms a similar pageant played out in the philippines on sunday with heads of state wearing barong tagalogs  embroidered formal shirts  to a welcome ceremony at the association of southeast asian nations summit on monday leaders gathered for a family photo observing a tradition that requires them to line up and cross one arm over the other shaking the opposite hand of the person next to them trump didnt appear to know how it worked but gamely laughed and grimaced through awkward moments as they jockeyed for position figured out what to do with their arms and executed the handshake but the bigger news from manila surrounded trumps decision not to press rodrigo duterte his host about his history of human rights abuses when the two met facetoface the meeting was one of the most anticipated of the summit with human rights groups pressing trump to take a tough line on dutertes bloody drug war that has claimed thousands of lives duterte who has spoken highly of trump last week said he would tell him to lay off if the topic of extrajudicial killings came up the issue of human rights did not arise it was not brought up dutertes spokesman harry roque told reporters after the 40minute meeting white house press secretary sarah sanders said afterward that the conversation focused on isis illegal drugs and trade she said that human rights briefly came up in the context of the philippines fight against illegal drugs but roque insisted duterte had broached the subject of the drug menace in the philippines himself it was president duterte who brought up with president trump the drug menace in the philippines and the us president appeared sympathetic and did not have any official position on the matter but was merely nodding his head roque said there was no mention of human rights there was no mention of extralegal killings he added in a separate statement to dailymailcom there was only a rather lengthy discussion of the philippine war on drugs with president duterte doing most of the explaining trump seemed to be appreciative of his efforts amnesty international accuses philippines police of executing defenseless people and paying assassins to kill drug addicts duterte insists he has never told them to break the law but said last year that he would be happy to slaughter three million addicts he has also repeatedly boasted about killing people himself most recently last thursday in da nang when i was a teenager i would go in and out of jail id have rumbles here rumbles there said duterte at the age of 16 i already killed someone a real person a rumble a stabbing i was just 16 years old it was just over a look how much more now that i am president trump made a point of visiting with american troops in pearl harbor hawaii and ate lunch with american and south korean troops at a joint air base near seoul first lady melania trump also stopped on her way home in alaska to meet with servicemen and women that visit came after solo appearances at the great wall of china and the beijing zoo melania also learned japanese calligraphy at a tokyo primary school and held an event promoting girls sports \n",

      " by megan rowling bonn germany nov 14 thomson reuters foundation  germany on tuesday pledged $125 million to boost the work of an international insurance partnership that aims to cover 400 million more poor and vulnerable people against disaster risks by 2020 that goal was first set in 2015 by the g7 group of wealthy nations but the effort has now been expanded to bring in other partners including the world bank and an alliance of about 50 countries vulnerable to climate threats including small island states like fiji which is presiding over the talks in bonn in july britain contributed 30 million pounds $394 million to establish a centre for global disaster protection fijis prime minister frank bainimarama said that when powerful cyclone winston hit his nation last year wiping out 30 percent of its economy tens of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed and many households were uninsured people protected by their wealth have no idea of the heartbreak of the poor and most vulnerable when they lose their homes and livelihoods in climaterelated disasters he told an event to launch the partnership fiji needs new forms of finance to develop while also reducing the risks of weather extremes and rising seas to tourism forests fisheries and agriculture as well as to infrastructure much of which is exposed on the coast he said the insuresilience global partnership will develop and roll out innovative finance and insurance solutions for individual countries tailored to the needs and challenges of their poor people in particular it said those will include sovereign risk pools like the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility ccrif which has paid out $62 million to 10 caribbean countries since hurricanes irma and maria brought destruction to the island states in september using the additional funds announced tuesday on the sidelines of the un climate talks in bonn the global partnership will also aim to expand schemes such as the nwk agriservices cotton company in zambia which offers weather and life insurance to small contract farmers and is already backed by insuresilience in 2015 some 52000 farmers bought insurance of whom more than 23000 received payments after a major drought in 2016 allen chastanet prime minister of st lucia said the ccrif had proved to be an amazing asset enabling quick access to funds after a disaster but it was just as important to provide money to help caribbean nations adapt to climate change to help prevent catastrophic losses he said insurance is not dealing with the overall solution it is dealing with the symptom not the actual cause he said aid agencies working in developing countries to reduce the risks of disasters said the partnership must also look at ways to help vulnerable communities prepare better for climate threats besides providing insurance insurance doesnt actually reduce risk and it could be unaffordable for the communities its meant to cover said tracy carty head of oxfams delegation at the bonn conference no other choice ibrahim thiaw deputy executive director of un environment said the expansion of insurance could help bring down its costs as has happened in africa with mobile phones which are now almost everywhere insurance is booming around climate it will grow because people have no other choice they need that buffer to protect themselves he told a separate discussion the group of climatevulnerable countries working with insuresilience including bangladesh ethiopia and costa rica are also working on their own schemes such as the planned sustainable insurance and takaful facility which is based on the principles of islamic finance it aims to close the gaps in insurance protection and disaster risk reduction for its member states 1 billion people only 14 percent of whom have access to some form of risk cover members would contribute to a fund that pays out when a disaster hits as well as supporting adaptation and green

      " by francesco guarascio brussels nov 14 reuters  the european union has called very publicly for malta to bring to justice the killers of a journalist who accused the mediterranean islands leaders of profiting from global corruption but it has for years been much less vocal  and had little success  in ensuring malta act to prevent money laundering according to sources familiar with the work of the maltese authorities and a reuters review of eu and maltese data the data show the smallest eu state has been slow to apply international guidelines on naming firms that do not take action against dubious practices and the number of convictions and sanctions for money laundering has been low malta has also consistently registered fewer reports of suspect transactions from banks casinos and other financial operators than any other eu state according to the data despite having a disproportionately large financial sector the european parliament on tuesday debated the rule of law in malta and will vote on wednesday on a resolution that says several serious allegations of corruption and breach of antimoney laundering obligations were not investigated by the maltese police but criticism of malta on money laundering  in lowkey reports by international supervisory bodies and by anticorruption campaigner daphne caruana galizia killed by a car bomb on oct 16  appears so far to have had little impact malta has sold its sovereignty to dirty money the european commission should take a more active role in investigating the condition of rule of law in malta sven giegold a member of european parliament from germanys greens party who campaigns against financial crime told reuters he said an international investigator was needed to counter a culture of impunity and fiddling between political and economic elites in malta prime minister joseph muscat told reuters last month maltas financial services sector was as transparent solid and compliant as any other european jurisdiction european commission vice president frans timmermans told lawmakers on tuesday the eu executive had no general concerns about maltas compliance with antimoney laundering laws though improvements could be made on various levels finance hub despite having a population of only 420000 malta a former british naval stronghold south of sicily has a financial sector that dwarfs many eu countries it is also the european leader in online gaming in 2016 assets of banks and financial institutions in malta were more than 20 times its gross domestic product about five times the equivalent figure for germany and nearly four times the euro zone average european central bank figures show yet in a report on the eus antimoney laundering efforts that was released without fanfare in september europol said malta reported fewer suspect transactions than other eu states between 2008 when it adopted the euro and 2014 europol also raised concerns that malta and cyprus may be failing to report as many cases as they should the supervisory authorities receive very few reports given the size of their banking sectors and the significance of these jurisdictions in offshore financial services europol said maltas financial intelligence analysis unit fiau the countrys antimoney laundering agency received 202 reports of suspect transactions in 2014 the last year for which europol data are available lithuania recorded the next fewest  over 50 percent more than malta in a financial sector one sixth the size by contrast the netherlands a much bigger economy reported 277532 dubious movements in 2014 the highest number in the euro zone fiaus deputy director alfred zammit told reuters it was impossible to conduct a meaningful comparison among eu countries based on available statistics because of different structures and reporting regimes in member states it is indeed arguable that given the size of the financial sector in malta one would expect to see more suspicious transaction reports submitted to the fiau zammit said but he said malta was tackling the problem by increasing awareness of the obligation to report by organising training sessions the annual number of reports in malta more than doubled from 2014 to 2017 although the proportion of those that were passed to the police fell to 11 percent last year from 24 percent in 2013 fiau data show the maltese police and the fiau did not respond to questions from reuters on how many of these cases were investigated or led to successful prosecutions convictions maltas court handed down four money laundering criminal convictions last year but disclosed none in the financial sector the results of a european parliament inquiry released this month said the number of convictions was extremely low and the institutions implementing and enforcing rules on money laundering were highly politicized banks not complying with moneylaundering rules have received small fines which in few cases were made public contrary to guidelines recommending exposure to deter wrongdoing zammit said the public disclosure of a higher number of sanctioned institutions would have been disproportionate when compared to the nature of the breach moneyval the antimoney laundering watchdog of the council of europe europes leading human rights organisation has also raised concerns it said in a 2012 report that maltas reporting of suspicious transactions was low for the size of its market in a subsequent report in 2015 moneyval found the country largely compliant a moneyval spokesman told reuters the latest report was however not based on a full assessment of the maltese legal framework editing by alastair macdonald and timothy heritage \n",

challenges in asia trump will appeal to house republicans directly during a caucus after his return the president is retraining his focus on the domestic policy hurdle this week after   12day endurance test in asia he lands late tuesday evening in washington after a midday stop in hawaii for the refueling of the presidential aircraft trump said he was excited to be heading home to see the house pass a great tax bill with the middle class getting big tax cuts in a tweet on monday evening as he prepared to leave the philippines the white house had informed several outlets earlier in the day of trumps capitol hill trip his parade around the house side of the legislative building follows a handful of appearances by white house officials who stayed behind while he traveled to asia first daughter ivanka counselor kellyanne conway treasury secretary steve mnuchin and national economic council chairman gary cohn took turns wooing lawmakers last week at the nations capitol since trump departed for asia a dispute broke between republicans in the house and the senate over key components of tax reform including the number of brackets the proposed rate on top earners and a tax giveaway to corporations that the president prizes with tax brackets of 12 percent 25 percent and 35 percent with a top rate of 396 percent on households making more than a $1 million for couples and $500000 for individual filers the house bill closely resembles a tax agreement between the trump administration and capitol hill trump had pushed for a tax cap of 35 percent but compromised on the rate for the nations top earners he gave into house republicans demands on the corporate tax rate as well accepting a reduction to 20 percent from the existing rate of 35 percent instead of the 15 percent rate hed aggressively went after senate republicans came back with a totally separate plan that defies trumps demand to simplify the tax code down to three easy to understand tax brackets it proposes rates of 10 12 225 25 325 35 and 385 percent and delays trumps corporate tax rate abatement to 2019 the oneyear lag reduces the price tag of the legislation by $100 billion but it is unsupported by trumps white house another aspect of tax reform the house and senate cant come to an agreement on is the deduction of state and local taxes salt the house bill proposes a deduction of up to $10000 in property taxes senate legislation gets rid of the benefit altogether both bills raise the standard deduction to $12000 for individuals and $24000 for joint filers  a measure thats crucial to white house support the joint committee on taxation a nonpartisan arm of congress knocked the wind of out the senate proposal on monday when it said that 91 percent of americans would see their taxes go up a tax hike would hit 16 million americans making less than $200000 a year 138 million of which make less than $100000 a year that compares to the house tax plan which boasts a savings of $1182 for a family of four house speaker paul ryan has said even that is a drop from the $4000 a year the white house had claimed that average families would net the dwindling savings for middleclass americans is contributing to the bills steep climb house republicans are seeking to pass their bill by thanksgiving to meet trumps deadline the president has said he wants the entire proposal wrapped up in time

even further cut top rate to 35 wall of the rest going to middle income cuts the president said brady said monday that trumps obamacare proposal remains under consideration even though its not

      " nicola sturgeon has told theresa may that the eu withdrawal bill is not acceptable to the scottish government in its current form speaking after talks at 10 downing street the scottish first minister said that no agreement on the way forward for brexit was reached but held out prospects of differences being ironed out in the weeks to come the devolved administrations of both scotland and wales have branded the legislation  which began its committee stage in the house of commons on tuesday  a power grab as it would return responsibilities in areas such as agriculture from brussels to london downing street said that the prime minister told ms sturgeon that her priority was to provide certainty to businesses and people both in scotland and across the country as well as protecting our uk internal market the scottish first minister characterised the 45 minutes of talks as constructive and cordial but she added i made very clear as the scottish government has done consistently that the withdrawal bill as it stands would not be acceptable and we would not be able to recommend approval of that that remains the position but hopefully having had the opportunity to air the concerns that we have in more detail we will be able to see progress in the weeks to come ms sturgeon added while we didnt reach agreement i think we developed a better understanding of each others positions i made clear that the scottish government wants to find agreement on the withdrawal bill we oppose brexit but we understand withdrawal legislation is necessary so we want to find agreement but i also made clear what our bottom lines are on that bill discussions will continue and hopefully we can reach some points of agreement in the weeks to come in discussions on brexit downing street said the pm told ms sturgeon that it remains her priority to provide certainty to businesses and people both in scotland and across the country as well as protecting our uk internal market a spokesman added they spoke about progress in agreeing principles on common frameworks at the recent joint ministerial committee and the prime minister reiterated that as powers are repatriated from brussels back to britain there will be a significant increase in the decisionmaking powers for the scottish government and other devolved administrations the prime minister encouraged the scottish government to continue to work with counterparts to secure the best outcome for the people of scotland and the whole of the uk the pair also discussed the recent wave of allegations of improper conduct and sexual harassment in politics north and south of the border both agreeing such behaviour was completely unacceptable said number 10 they agreed to work collaboratively to ensure that the right systems are in place to protect and support those working across the uks parliamentary institutions said a spokesman ms sturgeon said that mrs mays decision to put the date and time of brexit onto the face of the withdrawal bill was not sensible i dont think it is a sensible move to put the date of exit in legislation said the first minister i think looking at how this process has unfolded over the past few months the lesson of all of it should be not to back the uk further and further into a corner  and it strikes me that a move like that is narrowing room for manoeuvre and flexibility and at this stage of negotiations i dont think that is the right thing to do asked about sexual harassment she said we discussed that at some length we shared our experiences in terms of what the different parties are doing to try to put the right procedures in place what our two parliaments are doing agreed that it would be useful for parliaments and indeed the governments to keep in dialogue about that but we also agreed  and for me this is the most important aspect of this as well  having robust procedures in place is important its the underlying culture of sexual harassment that has to change and that i think is what we all hope will come out of the experiences of the last few weeks \n",

      " a deputy governor at the bank of england has defended his decision to vote against this months interest rate hike saying it would be better to wait for signs of rising wage growth before pulling the trigger sir jon cunliffe the banks deputy governor for financial stability and a member of the ratesetting monetary policy committee mpc suggested that the bank may be blindly relying on economic models which predict that wages will rise in response to lower unemployment leaving it at risk of overestimating domestic inflationary pressure given the uncertainties  and the serial disappointments we have had in recent years in forecasting the impact of unemployment on pay growth there is in my view a not immaterial risk that the tradeoff is not as it currently appears and that domestic inflation pressure will undershoot the committees collective expectation sir jon said in a speech to the oxford economics society he said that the lack of evidence around homegrown pressures on prices should allow the bank to wait longer before raising interest rates in my view the low level of domestic pressure on inflation now the absence of second round effects from the depreciation of sterling and inflation expectations around their historical averages make it possible to wait before tightening policy until there is clear evidence that pay growth is responding to the level of unemployment in line with our forecast he said official figures released on tuesday showed that the consumer prices index cpi measure of inflation held steady at 3 in october unchanged from a fiveyear high in september and 1 above the bank of englands 2 target but the spike in inflation has been primarily linked to the effects of the brexithit pound which has made imported products more expensive and impacted prices at home sir jon was one of two mpc members who voted to keep rates at record lows of 025 earlier this month alongside sir dave ramsden  amid fears over muted wage growth and doubts over the banks forecast for domestic inflation pressures to pick up however they were outnumbered by the remaining seven members of the mpc resulting in a reversal of an interest rate cut that followed the brexit vote and marking the banks first hike in a decade sir jon explained that while the bank does not have a mandate to monitor or adjust for employment levels or wage growth they provided additional evidence and could better inform mpc decisions on interest rates while neither unemployment nor pay is part of our target the relationship between them is important to our understanding of domestically generated inflationary pressure in the economy and how it is likely to evolve over the two to threeyear period over which monetary policy can have influence sir jon said and arguably since the crisis that relationship has become more important to our understanding of inflationary pressure in the economy \n",

      " washington ap  the sale to a russian company of a canadian firm with rights to mine us uranium is again in the news with the department of justice signaling it could appoint a special counsel to look into the matter president donald trump and his supporters have criticized the deal which attracted little attention when it was approved by the obama administration and suggested it may implicate former secretary of state hillary clinton in wrongdoing those allegations have been repeatedly denied by clintons camp and former obama administration officials in addition independent factcheckers have found some of the critics allegations to be flawed or misrepresented a look at the sale of uranium one to russias nuclear energy agency rosatom the deal rosatom acquired a majority stake in uranium one in 2010 and bought the remainder of the company in 2013 because uranium one had holdings in american uranium mines which at the time accounted for about 20 percent of americas licensed uranium mining capacity rosatoms 2010 purchase had to be approved by the committee on foreign investment in the united states that committee known as cfius is made up of officials from nine federal agencies including the state department which clinton ran at the time other agencies represented on the committee include the departments of treasury defense commerce energy and homeland security and the office of the us trade representative the allegations trump and his supporters have accused clinton of overseeing the sale of 20 percent of americas uranium supply to russia they see her alleged role as a scandal particularly amid charges the trump campaign colluded with russia in the 2016 presidential election allegations have also been made that the approval of the sale of uranium one benefited major donors to the clinton foundation raising conflictofinterest questions the matter took on new life after a report last month said the fbi was investigating possible russian attempts to influence the us nuclear sector at the time cfius was considering the sale of uranium one to rosatom the report said members of the committee including clinton should have known about the investigation and it questioned why they would have approved it the facts the rosatomuranium one deal did not sell 20 percent of americas uranium to russia the 20 percent figure cited by critics reflects only licensed uranium mining capacity in the us at the time of the sale not total uranium reserves or even actual production and without a specific license to export uranium from uranium ones mines which it did not have at the time rosatom would not be able to send it to russia or elsewhere in terms of the cfius approval clinton has said she had nothing to do with it as secretary of state she technically had a seat on the panel but most other cabinetlevel members historically have delegated such responsibilities to less senior officials the alleged relationship between the approval of the sale and the clinton foundation was first raised in 2015 by conservative author peter schweizer he and others have pointed to some of the investors in the deal and their ties to former president bill clinton and his foundation in april 2015 the new york times published an article echoing much of the schweizer book including one sensational contention that not long after the russians said they wanted to acquire a majority stake in uranium one bill clinton received $500000 for a speech in moscow the speech was paid for by a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin as it promoted uranium one stock canadian financier frank giustra a top clinton foundation donor sold his company urasia to uranium one which was chaired by ian telfer also a clinton foundation donor giustra has said he sold his stake in the deal in 2007 while hillary clinton and barack obama were vying for the democratic presidential nomination politifact found that the majority of the donations from individuals related to uranium one and urasia were made before and during clintons 2008 presidential campaign  but before she became secretary of state \n",

      " donald trump jr has attempted to dismiss claims he secretly liaised with wikileaks during the 2016 election by tweeting out a series of messages he had with the organization trump jr revealed what he said was the entire chain of twitter direct messages with wikileaks between september 2016 and july this year in which the antisecrecy group sought to feed information to the trump campaign and enhance the impact of its clinton releases following one message in which don jr and wikileaks discussed the release of documents hacked from clinton campaign chair john podesta thenpresidential candidate trump tweeted about the leak throughout his correspondences with wikileaks the eldest trump never rebuffed the transparency group led by julian assange with connections to the kremlin but would instead answer messages courteously or not reply to them at all trump jrs lawyer has suggested that his clients conversations with wikileaks had been sent to the atlantic by a member of congress who had access to the messages by way of the russia probe a source familiar with the congressional investigations on russia said trump jr emailed a number of senior campaign officials including jared kushner kellyanne conway steve bannon and digital director brad parscale to inform them wikileaks had made contact in september 2016 kushner president trumps soninlaw forwarded the email about it to campaign press secretary hope hicks who is now the white house communications director  meaning that a large swath of trumps inner circle knew of the conversations president trumps own cia director mike pompeo has warned the country about the assangefronted group its time to call out wikileaks for what it really is a nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like russia he said at a speech in april  but until monday trump jr did not disclose these conversations publicly even though assange had openly spoke of making contact with the first son in the first message given to the atlantic dated september 20 2016 wikileaks tried giving the trump son a heads up about an antitrump political action committee that was launching a pac run antitrump site putintrumporg is about to launch wikileaks wrote the pac is a recycled proiraq war pac we have guessed the password it is putintrump see about for who is behind it any comments the site  started by tech entrepreneur rob glaser exists today as a reporting project in conjunction with liberal website mother jones and explores the trumprussia connection then trump jr didnt know much about it as he informed the wikileaks twitter handle through his first known direct message to the controversial group off the record i dont know who that is but ill ask around the trump son wrote adding thanks to his message donald trump jrs conversations with wikileaks would continue for the next several weeks with him sometimes responding and other times seemingly taking the groups advice on october 3 2016 trump jr was a step ahead of wikileaks the group wrote to trump hiya itd be great if you guys could comment onpush this story wikileaks wrote pointing out that hillary clinton had said she wanted to  just drone  wikileaks founder julian assange already did that earlier today trump jr replied its amazing what she can get away with he added two minutes later he wanted more whats behind this wednesday leak i keep reading about trump jr asked though was ignored the atlantic figured out that the day before trumps longtime political adviser roger stone who held no official role for the campaign wrote wednesday hillaryclinton is done wikileaks thenpresidential candidate donald trump had proclaimed to a pennsylvania crowd i love wikileaks on october 10 after the organization had published some of clinton campaign chairman john podestas stolen emails two days later wikileaks responded to trump jrs twitter message hey donald great to see you and your dad talking about our publications wikileaks wrote back instead messaging back donald trump jr on october 12  strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us the message included a link to the podesta emails leak trump jr did not respond to the message but 15 minutes later thenpresidential candidate trump tweeted very little pickup by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by wikileaks so dishonest rigged system wikileaks also suggested that donald trump jr tweet out a link that would allow his fathers followers to dig through the trove of stolen clinton documents theres many great stories the press are missing and were sure some of your followers will find it wikileaks said btw we just released podesta emails part 4 two days later trump jr tweeted the link to the podesta emails writing for those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the wikileaks emails are right here httpwlsearchtk after this donald trump jr stopped responding to wikileaks messages the group wanted him on october 21 to leak one of his fathers tax returns in order to make it look like wikileaks was an impartial operator wikileaks argued that its site would be a better arbiter to release them than a more liberal news publication like the new york times or msnbc the new york times had previously released part of trumps returns if we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality wikileaks noted that means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on clinton will have much higher impact because it wont be perceived as coming from a protrump prorussia source the same for any other negative stuff documents recordings that you think has a decent chance of coming out wikileaks continued let us put it out trump jr didnt do anything with the offer wikileaks had an idea for how the trumps could play election day too hi don if your father loses we think it is much more interesting if he does not concede and spends time challenging the media and other types of rigging that occurredas he has implied that he might do wikileaks wrote on election night hours before the final results would come in the discussion can be transformative as it exposes media corruption primary corruption pac corruption etc trump jr didnt bite on that suggestion as well  because he didnt need to with his father elected wikileaks later just wrote back wow in december 16 2016 several weeks into the presidential transition wikileaks tried again asking trump jr for a favor hi don hope youre doing well in relation to mr assange obamaclinton placed pressure on sweden uk and australia his home country to illicitly go after mr assange wikileaks wrote it would be real easy and helpful for your dad to suggest that australia appoint assange ambassador to washington dc presidentelect trump wikileaks thought could say something to the affect of thats a real smart tough guy and the most famous australian sic you have they wont do it but it will send the right signals to australia uk + sweden to start following the law and stop bending it to ingratiate themselves with the clintons wikileaks said trump jr didnt answer the groups request the atlantic found that through the winter and spring wikileaks didnt have much contact with the eldest trump son who forgoed going to washington like his sister ivanka to instead take the reins of the trump businesses in new york but on july 11 2017 three days after the new york times broke the story about a trump tower meeting donald trump jr had a year before with a russian lawyer who was promised to have dirt on hillary clinton wikileaks contacted the trump son and had a thought hi don sorry to hear about your problems wikileaks wrote we have an idea that may help a little we are very interested in confidentially obtaining and publishing a copy of the emails cited in the new york times today the emails contained a promise from music publicist rob goldstone who was setting up the meeting between trump campaign officials and russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya that there was russian dirt on clinton we think this is strongly in your interest wikileaks advised trump jr of leaking his emails on the site as it would prevent journalists from casting the meeting in a negative light us publishing not only deprives them of this ability but is beautifully confounding again trump jr didnt respond though later published the emails himself using twitter several hours later assange took credit for the idea contacted trump jr this morning on why he should publish his emails ie with us assange wrote two hours later does it himself response on social media has been divided mainly down the political divide some have heralded the correspondence as proof of the trump administrations ties to russia and called for special counsel robert mueller to investigate as part of his probe others pointed to the lack of response from trump jr in the messages as evidence of his lack of collusion donald trump jrs lawyer alan futerfas made reference to the fact that his clients conversations had been leaked to the atlantic when responding to the publications inquiry over the last several months we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests futerfas said putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents provided to congress under promises of confidentiality have been selectively leaked we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum futerfas added the house and senate intelligence committee along with the senate judiciary committee have been looking into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election  along with looking for evidence of collusion with the trump campaign special counsel robert mueller is also looking into the issue having taken over the fbis probe in september donald trump jr spoke with congressional investigators however hes not testified about russian influence in an open public session \n",

      " a virtual nation complete with its own constitution and citizens has launched into space the small satellite roughly the size of a loaf of bread aims to establish asgardias sovereign territory carrying half a terabyte of data into orbit asgardia1 launched to the international space station with the orbital atk cygnus spacecraft and will remain there until it deploys to lowearth orbit in three weeks scroll down for video asgardia will be the first space nation it is described as a fullyfledged and independent nation and a future member of the united nations the asgardia project team is made up of experts from around the globe the project team is being led by dr igor ashurbeyli a russian scientist and founder of the aerospace international research center airc in vienna by creating a new space nation the experts behind the project hope to  develop future space technology free from the restrictions of state control alongside its announcement asgardia opened up applications for virtual citizenship via its  and so far almost half a million people have pledged their allegiance the first asgardia satellite will launch in september this year one of asgardias first projects will be the creation of a protective shield to protect humankind from space debris including asteroids the socalled virtual nation asgardia launched atop the antares rocket from nasas wallops flight facility in virginia on nov 12  doing so satisfies the last condition necessary for admission to the un according to asgardia asgardia has designed a constitution which has already been accepted and it even has its own cryptocurrency called the solar which is registered at the european union intellectual property office the first nation in space also has a flag and a coat of arms the project was hatched by an international group of scientists and backed by a russian billionaire dr igor ashurbeyli but its already been met with a number of challenges earlier this year  the team behind the plan revealed theyre having difficulties organizing the new country the team led by dr igor ashurbeyli billionaire and founder of the aerospace international research center in vienna unveiled the bizarre plans at a press conference in paris last october dr ashurbeyli said at the time he believed the spacebound private country could offer an independent platform free from the constraint of a landbased countrys laws  however it seems some more human problems are getting in the way of this vision dr ashurbeyli told wall street journal the biggest issue is selforganisation no one has ever tried organisingwhat is today 100000 citizens from 200 countries who dont know each other and live in different places on earth he said future asgardians speak many different languages and also have different political systems which could lead to political unrest there is also debate as to whether the new nation should accept refugees from earth out of the 300000 that initially signed up online only 110000 approved the constitution and were granted citizenship my task is to defend planet earth and defend humanity he said before launching he wants the un to recognise asgardia as a country potential inhabitants have raised concerns about the constitution and how power will be shared among the spacedwellers dr ashurbeyli said it would be a constitutional monarchy similar to those in europe with himself as king and a fixed term of five years there is also concern about how taxation will work  which according to the constitution is voluntary these issues are part of the teams attempt to form an independent country outside of the legal and physical bounds of our planet the primary payload is a solid state device hard drive asgardia said in a june federal communications commission fcc filing  the drive is loaded on the ground with data and the data is updated once in orbit a file is returned that verifies successful data transmission the nanosatellite will measure just 4 by 4 by 8 inches 10 by 10 by 20 cm  roughly the size of a loaf of bread  and weigh about 5 pounds 23 kg it will come loaded with two particle detectors mounted internally and externally to test technologies that are key to the groups goals from this data we can map the solar flux and determine the radiation dosing that the internal electronics are receiving the application said the project aims to create a new framework for ownership and nationhood in space by creating a completely new nation according to the project leaders if the nation did come to fruition it would pave the way for offplanet data and tax havens floating in space one of the early developments planned by the team will be the creation of a stateoftheart protective shield for all humankind this will protect the world from cosmic  threats both manmade and natural to life on earth this includes space debris solar flares and asteroid collisions the researchers say there are estimated to be more than 20000 traceable objects of manmade space junk including old spacecraft upperstage rockets and final stage vehicles  in nearearth orbits natural objects in space also pose a threat to life on the planet for example  the chelyabinsk meteorite which crashed over a major russian town in 2013 injured 1100 people and damaged 4000 buildings there are estimated to be more than 20000 traceable objects

of the chelyabinsk meteorite which crashed over a major russian town in 2013 injuring 1100 people and damaging 4000 buildings the projects concept comprises three parts  philosophical legal and scientifictechnological said dr ashurbeyli asgardia is a fullyfledged and independent nation and a future member of the united nations  with all the attributes this status entails the founder says the essence of asgardia is peace in space and the prevention of earths conflicts being transferred into space as lowearth orbit becomes more accessible whats often called the democratisation of space a pathway is opening up to new ideas and approaches from a rich diversity of participants said professor david alexander director of the rice space institute at rice university houston texas the mission of asgardia to create opportunities for broader access to space enabling nontraditional space nations to realise their scientific aspirations is exciting  \n",

will be allowed to return to the states for future filming endeavours in a carefully worded statement heaton said he was working to rectify the situation which is said to have occurred after sniffer dogs detected the cocaine on his person my planned travel to the us last week was affected by an issue at us immigration and i am working to rectify it as soon as possible the star told people magazine i do want to clarify that i was not arrested or charged with a crime and cooperated fully with the us officials at lax following the drugs detection charlie was questioned before being sent back to england on a return flight and was unable to attend the premiere for the second season of stranger things im sorry to all the fans and my stranger things family for missing the premiere he said we are all so proud of this season and i would never want this story to negatively impact the show charlies mother and sister previously said a small amount of cocaine found its way on to his wallet at a party two weeks earlier or at a bar or at a shop without his knowledge family of the actor say he has never done drugs in the past and was not under the influence at the time he was stopped at the airport charlie has since undergone tests including a hair and urine sample which have come back all clear according to his family they are now hoping the misunderstanding blows over sooner rather than later to allow the british star and continue filming for stranger things but they have criticised how charlie was treated by us officials claiming he was interrogated for three hours and wasnt allowed to call anyone or ask for a lawyer they blamed his treatment on his tv star status and claim he was used as a target speaking at the family home in bridlington east yorkshire his mother michelle lowe 50 said all that rubbish its completely fabricated i know that but thats all im allowed to say on it hes never done drugs in the past its completely made up thats what papers do im not his agent im just his mum so i cant really say too much he is sort of between here london and america it would be awful if he wasnt allowed back to america to film but i dont see it shouldnt be he has proven his innocence it could happen to any of us you go to a bar or a party its just unfortunate really i know thats what has happened i hope it blows over his sister kayleigh heaton 32 added it could have come from anywhere he wasnt carrying drugs he wasnt high hes had tests and they have come back clear he not got it in his system or anything he was at a party two weeks before and obviously when youre at a party anything can happen you leave your things on the side when youre having a drink it could be that he was at a shop it be on a note what theyve done is wrong they didnt give him a chance to call anybody they didnt give him a chance to have a lawyer they put him in a room for three hours and just interrogated him and interrogated him so it wasnt done correctly they didnt follow procedure i think they saw him they noticed him and they used him as a target he wasnt carrying anything he wasnt under the influence or any drugs i think its just a misunderstanding hes been unfortunate where hes been to a party somehow cocaine has got either on his wallet or on his cards were not sure he didnt know anything about it he went to the airport to fly they checked and he is racking his brain about how this could happen he hasnt done anything he wasnt carrying anything hes had tests that have come back clean he has had hair sample a blood test and urine sample which are absolutely clean a hair sample can last up to five months so that proves he hasnt taken anything i think it will be fine because its not like he has done anything due to his demanding schedule filming hitshow stranger things in los angeles yorkshireborn heaton is not believed to see his son regularly the youngster lives with his mother who performs in the band the big pink in london it is

have become addicted to opioids prescribed to them for chronic pain the american opioid epidemic has killed more people than has warfare in iraq  where westphal fought  afghanistan and vietnam combined more than a decade after joining the army in 2004 westphal is 90 days sober and hopeful but hes battled back from devastating injuries and addictions to both prescription and street drugs that have nearly claimed his life more than once westphal was 24 and in love when he decided to join the army on april fools day in 2004 i wanted to be able to have a secure means of financing everything i need for my family and a good respectable lifestyle doing something id enjoy giving back to my country he says he joined up completed his basic training and was stationed in van holder germany he spent the coming seven years in the service maintaining a long distance relationship with the woman he loved before then westphal says hed never experienced serious drugs i was like most young guys and girls are in college drinking and partying sociably he says but id never been involved with drugs within the year he was sent on his first deployment to ramadi in iraq during that first deployment westphals convoy was blown up a staggering six times over the course of two weeks it was like every other day that my humvee was struck by ieds he says then the seventh time i was blown up was the last time westphal says a taxi driver blew himself up about 15 meters from our patrol mine was the second truck it took the majority of the blast he remembers the seven explosions left westphal with debilitating injuries to his lower back and hip multiple traumatic brain injuries and ptsd westphal was treated with spinal decompression shots after his first tour the injections worked well enough to get him through a second calmer tour but when he returned to germany a second time his military doctors started him on the cycle of painkillers loritab percocet morphine then oxycontin that time is when i became addicted thats when i knew i was abusing them he says i liked the way they made me feel on top of the pain more than half of veterans using veterans affairs health care facilities suffer from chronic pain often related to their service or injuries sustained on the battlefield on memorial day may 31 2011 westphal was discharged into medical retirement from his rank as a sergeant back in georgia the veterans health administration va was mailing him oxycontin for the pain adderall for the pain and klonopin or xanax to keep the ptsd at bay it was bad enough to where i was tracking it on the ups app so i could drive to the ups at four or five in the morning to get them he says usually by then westphal had already run out of his medications if i was out of drugs id bump into old friends and i purchased drugs off of them he says by this time his first son brandon had been born and he had married the girl hed fallen in love with years before westphal had the family hed wanted but they were struggling to keep it all together and make ends meet he was on extreme disability unable to work and receiving $300 each for himself and his son every week i was in good standing with my boy but my family was falling apart westphal says his relationship with his wife was becoming increasingly toxic and one night he recalls it all becoming too much he needed a further escape i went out and got cocaine started abusing cocaine when that wasnt enough i started smoking it smoking crack i was smoking marijuana all on top of my prescriptions says westphal this part of his life becomes hard for westphal recall between 2012 and 2016 westphals memories are vivid flashes of lucidity but they dont always come back to him in order westphal moved back and forth between mississippi and florida and in and out of a relationship with his nowestranged wife at some point he fell onto meth was arrested and sentenced to 30 days of jail time for it he struggled to take care of his sonswhile trying to hide the fact that i was still using drugs and self medicating after hed fallen out of cycle with his psychiatrist in florida for awhile under the care of his va doctor westphal got off of the opioids and was taking suboxone but after he had moved back to mississippi some time in 2015 westphal was hit by car and broke both of his legs he says a steel rod had to be placed in his leg in a painful surgery a civilian doctor prescribed him morphine he wasnt aware of my history with drugs even though doctors in mississippi are required by law to check a national database for a patients history with opioids westphal fell back right into the familiar downward spiral of drugs and trouble at home i didnt want to leave my kids in that mess and the only safe way i knew to get them taken care of was to not pay the power or the rent because i knew my family would pick up the slack he says he let the house go dark and his sons were taken to alabama where their grandparents had promised if there was ever an issue theyd take care of my boys westphal says evicted from his home westphal moved to las cruces new mexico to stay with his father in 2016 i was 36 years old i was living with my father and i was around just the worst kind of people you can imagine i didnt have to go anywhere  heroine ice meth readily available he says i was burning through $5100 a month and blowing through the drugs westphal says he started running with the dope dealers and even then he knew he shouldnt have trusted them before he got to new mexico he says hed never used needles before but next thing he knew westphal was dying in the dope boys house paramedics brought me back with a naloxone shot in the arm as well as a nasal spray version of the overdose treatment by june of this year remorse had set in for westphal but his addiction still had a firm hold on him i was beating myself up about this whole 15 years of my life ive wasted and how the only thing i got was two awesome little boys and the only thing i could was try to save them he says but i was still partying it up with whoever was around one night westphal and some friends took the party to a hotel room westphal regularly used 50 ml bags of crystal meth or ice he says he had been up for five or six days wired on ice someone offered him a bag to shoot up from in the hotel bathroom it wasnt westphals usual 50 of ice but a 100 ml mixture of both black tar heroin and crystal meth i took the whole hundred units and as i was shooting it all i wanted was to lay my head down in her lap  he was daydreaming of his nowestranged wife  and let her pet my hair and take a nap hazily westphal lay down on the bed he awoke to his brother a nurse standing over him im looking up at my brother and hes telling me he just brought me back to life and i was gone for three or four minutes says westphal when his brother found and revived him westphal says that was the last straw but i still finished that last eight ball of heroine after that harrowing night he stayed with his family for a few days and they helped him to make a call to american addiction centers aac westphal says he thought ive got to be a man again and figure out how to get my life together again and be respectable he told his father that he wanted to get clean after his first conversation with aac westphals father flew with him to las vegas where he began intensive inpatient treatment the las vegas treatment facility is american addictions largest and patients there undergo therapy involving a combination of medication  using methodone  and coaching to help them break their addictions dr tom doub chief clinical and compliance officer for aac says that its key to treat not just the addictions but the traumas experienced by veterans like westphal between five and six percent of the beds in aacs inpatient treatment facilities are occupied by veterans says dr doub treatment at aac costs somewhere between $12000 and $20000 for treatment programs lasting a month or more veterans require augmented services for dealing with addiction he says theres a very strong sense of comradeship and friendship and shared experience among people who have gone through some of the traumatic things that some of our vets have experiences he says westphal describes his first 40 days as being a newbie experiencing withdrawals and trying to adjust to life without drugs dr doub says that reintegrating and working through trauma are particularly important to veterans in recovery they feel that they need substances to feel normal he says westphal went out from the treatment center and had two brief relapses but i dont live that way any more he says i am 90 days sober today he told

      " the first wife of texas church killer has revealed disturbing new details about his violent past including the time he bragged to her about snapping his pet dogs neck when he was just 10 years old and then laughing about it tessa brennaman 25 broke her silence about her relationship with devin kelley in an emotional interview with inside edition friday recounting how the funny and generous teenage boy she had met while working at a burger joint near san antonio texas over the years transformed into a violent and abusive man who beat and sexually assaulted her and physically abused her infant son i was terrified really terrified brennaman told inside editions steven fabian he would choke me punch me kick me there would be times where i was on the floor curled up and having to protect my organs because he would be violently kicking me scroll down for video kelley a us air force airman married brennaman in april 2011 a week before moving to new mexico where he was to serve at the holloman air force base after being cut from an elite intelligence training program because of poor academic performance brennaman entered the marriage with a ninemonthold son from a previous relationship and kelley became the boys stepfather brennaman said kelley was battling severe depression and began beating her for even the slightest infractions like being late for appointments the woman also claimed her thenhusband sexually assaulted her but she said those incidents were too graphic and painful to discuss the most i can say is he did do it against my will and i told him not to and we would do it anyway she said during their time together brennaman said she was not allowed to go near kelleys phone it was not until later that she found out that her husband had a fake email address and would exchange sexually explicit messages with various women who would send him photos of breasts another red flag for brennaman was when kelley boasted to her about killing an animal in cold blood he was like you know when i was 10 years old i had a dog and it was play biting me and i snapped his neck and i thought it was really funny she said with a puzzled look on her face i was like who thinks like that their rocky marriage finally came undone in october 2012 after an incident in which brennaman said her husband pulled a gun on her in the car after she warned him about driving too fast on a remote highway and he had a gun in his holster right here and he took that gun out and he put it to my temple and he told me do you want to die do you want to die brennaman recalled during that fateful drive brennaman said kelley also came clean to her about beating her infant son and causing the baby to be hospitalized with a skull fracture three months prior which tessa had previously thought was due to an accident wiping away tears brennaman said she was angry at kelley which led her to turn him into the police in november 2012 kelley then 23 was courtmartialed and pleaded guilty to hitting choking kicking and pulling her hair as well as fracturing the skull of her young son he was confined to a military prison for one year in the case and received a bad conduct discharge from the air force the air force has admitted it failed to notify the fbi about the conviction which would have barred kelley from purchasing firearms meanwhile parishioners who survived the slaughter at first baptist church of sutherland said friday that a week before the massacre kelley acted bizarrely they said kelley showed up at a church festival dressed in black and acted so strangely that people kept a close eye on him kelley was completely distant and way out in thought recalled judy green she and her husband said kelley often exhibited troubling behavior at the fall festival held on halloween night at the first baptist church kelley didnt even blink  he just stared she said rod green a former law enforcement officer in montana said when he saw kelley arrive in all black he examined him closely to make sure he was not carrying a gun the greens both have licenses to carry handguns and they are friends with kelleys inlaws if kelley had been carrying a weapon rod green said he would have escorted him away because of all the children there judy green said she positioned herself to keep an eye on kelley at all times there was something wrong with the picture she said i was thinking forward and that was what was scaring me at a christmas dinner one year kelley had bragged about being armed rod green said investigators have said sundays shooting appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving kelley and the mother of his second wife and that he had sent threatening messages to her the motherinlaw sometimes attended services at the church but was not present on sunday kelley died of what appeared to be a selfinflicted gunshot wound after armed civilians chased him from the scene of the massacre eleven people remained hospitalized friday with wounds from the shooting before the church is demolished it will serve as a temporary memorial said rod green who also serves as the grounds steward for the church services will never take place there again sundays services will be held  at a nearby baseball field  \n",

      " by dustin volz washington nov 14 reuters  about 15 percent of us federal agencies have reported some trace of moscowbased kaspersky lab software on their systems a department of homeland security dhs official told congress on tuesday jeanette manfra assistant secretary for cyber security at dhs told a us house of representatives panel that 94 percent of agencies had responded to a directive ordering them to survey their networks to identify any use of kaspersky lab products and to remove them but manfra said dhs did not currently have conclusive evidence that any networks had been breached due to their use of kaspersky lab software the administration of president donald trump ordered civilian us agencies in september to remove kaspersky lab from their networks amid worries the antivirus firm was vulnerable to kremlin influence and that using its antivirus software could jeopardize national security the decision represented a sharp response to what us intelligence agencies have described as a national security threat posed by russia in cyberspace following an election year marred by allegations that moscow weaponized the internet in an attempt to influence its outcome kaspersky lab has repeatedly denied the allegations and moscow has denied that it sought to interfere in the 2016 presidential election the september dhs order required civilian agencies to identify any use of kaspersky lab products within 30 days and to discontinue their use within 90 days ninetysix of 102 federal agencies have reported to dhs on whether they have found kaspersky lab software on their networks manfra told the oversight subcommittee of the house science space and technology committee dhs is working with the remaining six very small agencies to assess their networks manfra said she did not name the agencies that detected kaspersky lab products or those that were still auditing their systems but said the government was generally complying with the directive to remove the software some lawmakers expressed agitation at why the us government having had suspicions about kaspersky lab for years did not move more quickly to purge its software from their networks manfra said she became personally aware of concerns about the firm in 2014 and that while dhs promptly took steps to remove software other agencies may have lagged in part because they did not have access to classified information the companys products generally appeared to land on us government networks through larger technology purchases that included kaspersky lab products as prebundled software making it more difficult to track according to manfra and other officials who were testifying on tuesday kaspersky lab has said previously that its footprint in the us federal government market was minimal to address suspicions kaspersky lab said last month it would submit the source code of its software and future updates for inspection by independent parties manfra said such a step while welcomed would not be sufficient to address concerns the us government has about kaspersky lab editing by bernadette baum \n",

      " donald trump jr has attempted to dismiss claims he secretly liaised with wikileaks during the 2016 election by tweeting out a series of messages he had with the organization trump jr revealed what he said was the entire chain of twitter direct messages with wikileaks between september 2016 and july this year in which the antisecrecy group sought to feed information to the trump campaign and enhance the impact of its clinton releases following one message in which don jr and wikileaks discussed the release of documents hacked from clinton campaign chair john podesta thenpresidential candidate trump tweeted about the leak throughout his correspondences with wikileaks the eldest trump never rebuffed the transparency group led by julian assange with connections to the kremlin but would instead answer messages courteously or not reply to them at all trump jrs lawyer has suggested that his clients conversations with wikileaks had been sent to the atlantic by a member of congress who had access to the messages by way of the russia probe a source familiar with the congressional investigations on russia said trump jr emailed a number of senior campaign officials including jared kushner kellyanne conway steve bannon and digital director brad parscale to inform them wikileaks had made contact in september 2016 kushner president trumps soninlaw forwarded the email about it to campaign press secretary hope hicks who is now the white house communications director  meaning that a large swath of trumps inner circle knew of the conversations president trumps own cia director mike pompeo has warned the country about the assangefronted group its time to call out wikileaks for what it really is a nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like russia he said at a speech in april  but until monday trump jr did not disclose these conversations publicly even though assange had openly spoke of making contact with the first son in the first message given to the atlantic dated september 20 2016 wikileaks tried giving the trump son a heads up about an antitrump political action committee that was launching a pac run antitrump site putintrumporg is about to launch wikileaks wrote the pac is a recycled proiraq war pac we have guessed the password it is putintrump see about for who is behind it any comments the site  started by tech entrepreneur rob glaser exists today as a reporting project in conjunction with liberal website mother jones and explores the trumprussia connection then trump jr didnt know much about it as he informed the wikileaks twitter handle through his first known direct message to the controversial group off the record i dont know who that is but ill ask around the trump son wrote adding thanks to his message donald trump jrs conversations with wikileaks would continue for the next several weeks with him sometimes responding and other times seemingly taking the groups advice on october 3 2016 trump jr was a step ahead of wikileaks the group wrote to trump hiya itd be great if you guys could comment onpush this story wikileaks wrote pointing out that hillary clinton had said she wanted to  just drone  wikileaks founder julian assange already did that earlier today trump jr replied its amazing what she can get away with he added two minutes later he wanted more whats behind this wednesday leak i keep reading about trump jr asked though was ignored the atlantic figured out that the day before trumps longtime political adviser roger stone who held no official role for the campaign wrote wednesday hillaryclinton is done wikileaks thenpresidential candidate donald trump had proclaimed to a pennsylvania crowd i love wikileaks on october 10 after the organization had published some of clinton campaign chairman john podestas stolen emails two days later wikileaks responded to trump jrs twitter message hey donald great to see you and your dad talking about our publications wikileaks wrote back instead messaging back donald trump jr on october 12  strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us the message included a link to the podesta emails leak trump jr did not respond to the message but 15 minutes later thenpresidential candidate trump tweeted very little pickup by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by wikileaks so dishonest rigged system wikileaks also suggested that donald trump jr tweet out a link that would allow his fathers followers to dig through the trove of stolen clinton documents theres many great stories the press are missing and were sure some of your followers will find it wikileaks said btw we just released podesta emails part 4 two days later trump jr tweeted the link to the podesta emails writing for those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the wikileaks emails are right here httpwlsearchtk after this donald trump jr stopped responding to wikileaks messages the group wanted him on october 21 to leak one of his fathers tax returns in order to make it look like wikileaks was an impartial operator wikileaks argued that its site would be a better arbiter to release them than a more liberal news publication like the new york times or msnbc the new york times had previously released part of trumps returns if we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality wikileaks noted that means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on clinton will have much higher impact because it wont be perceived as coming from a protrump prorussia source the same for any other negative stuff documents recordings that you think has a decent chance of coming out wikileaks continued let us put it out trump jr didnt do anything with the offer wikileaks had an idea for how the trumps could play election day too hi don if your father loses we think it is much more interesting if he does not concede and spends time challenging the media and other types of rigging that occurredas he has implied that he might do wikileaks wrote on election night hours before the final results would come in the discussion can be transformative as it exposes media corruption primary corruption pac corruption etc trump jr didnt bite on that suggestion as well  because he didnt need to with his father elected wikileaks later just wrote back wow in december 16 2016 several weeks into the presidential transition wikileaks tried again asking trump jr for a favor hi don hope youre doing well in relation to mr assange obamaclinton placed pressure on sweden uk and australia his home country to illicitly go after mr assange wikileaks wrote it would be real easy and helpful for your dad to suggest that australia appoint assange ambassador to washington dc presidentelect trump wikileaks thought could say something to the affect of thats a real smart tough guy and the most famous australian sic you have they wont do it but it will send the right signals to australia uk + sweden to start following the law and stop bending it to ingratiate themselves with the clintons wikileaks said trump jr didnt answer the groups request the atlantic found that through the winter and spring wikileaks didnt have much contact with the eldest trump son who forgoed going to washington like his sister ivanka to instead take the reins of the trump businesses in new york but on july 11 2017 three days after the new york times broke the story about a trump tower meeting donald trump jr had a year before with a russian lawyer who was promised to have dirt on hillary clinton wikileaks contacted the trump son and had a thought hi don sorry to hear about your problems wikileaks wrote we have an idea that may help a little we are very interested in confidentially obtaining and publishing a copy of the emails cited in the new york times today the emails contained a promise from music publicist rob goldstone who was setting up the meeting between trump campaign officials and russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya that there was russian dirt on clinton we think this is strongly in your interest wikileaks advised trump jr of leaking his emails on the site as it would prevent journalists from casting the meeting in a negative light us publishing not only deprives them of this ability but is beautifully confounding again trump jr didnt respond though later published the emails himself using twitter several hours later assange took credit for the idea contacted trump jr this morning on why he should publish his emails ie with us assange wrote two hours later does it himself response on social media has been divided mainly down the political divide some have heralded the correspondence as proof of the trump administrations ties to russia and called for special counsel robert mueller to investigate as part of his probe others pointed to the lack of response from trump jr in the messages as evidence of his lack of collusion donald trump jrs lawyer alan futerfas made reference to the fact that his clients conversations had been leaked to the atlantic when responding to the publications inquiry over the last several months we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests futerfas said putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents provided to congress under promises of confidentiality have been selectively leaked we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum futerfas added the house and senate intelligence committee along with the senate judiciary committee have been looking into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election  along with looking for evidence of collusion with the trump campaign special counsel robert mueller is also looking into the issue having taken over the fbis probe in september donald trump jr spoke with congressional investigators however hes not testified about russian influence in an open public session \n",

      " the clearest map ever produced of the amount of heat being released from deep within the earth below the antarctic has been released experts created the most up to date accurate and highresolution graphic of the geothermal heat flux reaching the base of the regions massive ice sheet the data used comes primarily from magnetic measurements collected by aircraft flying over the continent and shows hot spots in the area scientists believe global warming is already causing drastic alterations to the ice and higher levels of geothermal energy could worsen matters scroll down for video the study led by british antarctic survey bas reveals key areas under west antarctica and on the antarctic peninsula the most rapidly changing areas of the antarctic ice sheet of the various forces which shape and controls the flow of ice in the area geothermal heat is the most poorly studied the international team of scientists says the antarctic ice sheet contains the largest reservoirs of fresh water on our planet around 70 per cent of the worlds fresh water and is currently losing ice which contributes to rising sea levels heat at the bed of rock that sits under the ice sheet makes it easier for the ice to move however it is incredibly difficult to take direct measurements of heat from the earths interior beneath 18 to 24 miles three to four km of ice in extremely cold and hostile conditions instead the researchers have used magnetic data to infer the heat levels producing a heat map they say is 30 to 50 per cent more accurate than previous studies in a written statement bas glaciologist professor david vaughan said if we are to predict with any certainty the future response of antarctica in a warming world scientists need to understand the role that heat from the earth plays what we know is that over time the heat flow into the ice is quite constant and so the ice sheet adjusts to it the ice loss weve seen in recent decades is actually the result of changes in air and ocean temperatures how the ice sheet will respond to these recent changes is influenced by the pattern of geothermal heat and thats why this new map is so important the full findings of the study were  published in the journal geophysical research letters  just last week scientists uncovered new evidence for an ancient heat source beneath the west antarctic ice sheet the underground mantle plume is thought to be driving some of the melting seen beneath the ice giving rise to lakes and rivers its thought to have formed 50 to 110 million years ago long before the ice sheet itself it has likely played a role in rapid collapses that took place during past periods of climate change and it could help explain some of the instability seen today the suspected geothermal heat source is situated deep beneath antarcticas marie byrd land while its not a new phenomenon it could help scientists better estimate the rate of future ice loss in the area as the meltwater helps to lubricate the glaciers a scientist at the university of colorado denver first suggested the presence of a mantle plume beneath marie byrd 30 years ago this could explain volcanic activity and the dome feature in a new study researchers used numerical modelling with the ice sheet system model to study the plume revealing natural sources of heating and heat transport from a number of processes they scientists also used observations of changes in the altitude of the ice sheet surface captured by nasas icesat satellite and airborne operation icebridge campaign the study found that the energy flux from the mantle plume must not exceed 150 milliwatts per square meter  compared for example to a heat flux of 490 to 60 milliwatts in regions with no volcanic activity and an average 200 milliwatts per square meter beneath yellowstone \n",

has seen some troubles recently which involved his situation at lax airport in october where cocaine was detected on him with series three of the show being confirmed it is unclear whether charlie will be allowed to return to the states for future filming endeavours in a carefully worded statement heaton said he was working to rectify the situation which is said to have occurred after sniffer dogs detected the cocaine on his person my planned travel to the us last week was affected by an issue at us immigration and i am working to rectify it as soon as possible the star told people magazine i do want to clarify that i was not arrested or charged with a crime and cooperated fully with the us officials at lax following the drugs detection charlie was questioned before being sent back to england on a return flight and was unable to attend the premiere for the second season of stranger things im sorry to all the fans and my stranger things family for missing the premiere he said we are all so proud of this season and i would never want this story to negatively impact the show charlies mother and sister previously said a small amount of cocaine found its way on to his wallet at a party two weeks earlier or at a bar or at a shop without his knowledge family of the actor say he has never done drugs in the past and was not under the influence at the time he was stopped at the airport charlie has since undergone tests including a hair and urine sample which have come back all clear according to his family they are now hoping the misunderstanding blows over sooner rather than later to allow the british star and continue filming for stranger things but they have criticised how charlie was treated by us officials claiming he was interrogated for three hours and wasnt allowed to call anyone or ask for a lawyer they blamed his treatment on his tv star status and claim he was used as a target speaking at the family home in bridlington east yorkshire his mother michelle lowe 50 said all that rubbish its completely fabricated i know that but thats all im allowed to say on it hes never done drugs in the past its completely made up thats what papers do im not his agent im just his mum so i cant really say too much he is sort of between here london and america it would be awful if he wasnt allowed back to america to film but i dont see it shouldnt be he has proven his innocence it could happen to any of us you go to a bar or a party its just unfortunate really i know thats what has happened i hope it blows over his sister kayleigh heaton 32 added it could have come from anywhere he wasnt carrying drugs he wasnt high hes had tests and they have come back clear he not got it in his system or anything he was at a party two weeks before and obviously when youre at a party anything can happen you leave your things on the side when youre having a drink it could be that he was at a shop it be on a note what theyve done is wrong they didnt give him a chance to call anybody they didnt give him a chance to have a lawyer they put him in a room for three hours and just interrogated him and interrogated him so it wasnt done correctly they didnt follow procedure i think they saw him they noticed him and they used him as a target he wasnt carrying anything he wasnt under the influence or any drugs i think its just a misunderstanding hes been unfortunate where hes been to a party somehow cocaine has got either on his wallet or on his cards were not sure he didnt know anything about it he went to the airport to fly they checked and he is racking his brain about how this could happen he hasnt done anything he wasnt carrying anything hes had tests that have come back clean he has had hair sample a blood test and urine sample which are absolutely clean a hair sample can last up to five months so that proves he hasnt taken anything i think it will be fine because its not like he has done anything due to his demanding schedule filming hitshow stranger things in los angeles yorkshireborn heaton is not believed to see his son regularly the youngster lives with his mother who performs in the band the big pink in london it is

year and one before her home was raided by cops and animal control officers on june 16 this year fay denies a dozen charges of animal cruelty relating to the raid on her 13bedroom home in the upscale resort town of wolfeboro new hampshire speaking in a confident firm tone fay portrayed herself as a caring breeder who ran her business out of love and made just two per cent of her expenditure from selling them she said that in one calendar year alone she made 289 vet visits with the dogs it was a very expensive proposition she said i would never have taken in the number of dogs if i did not feel i could give them 1000 percent of what they deserve but fay said she realized she had made a huge mistake when she moved to wolfeboro from her previous home in maine i remember writing to my attorney and telling him it felt like we had landed in a stephen king town where they are so unwelcoming she said it has never been warm and fuzzy here fay a former veterinary technician at the bronx zoo in new york said she bought the house on 54 acres because she thought it would give her plenty of space but within 36 hours of moving in she got her first complaint about barking and from then on had to abandon the speciallybuilt gardens complete with air conditioned kennels that she had spent thousands on to house the dogs instead she said she had to move them inside the huge house to cut down on the noise her neighbors could hear the dogs were seized in june after complaints about fays business  which she called de la sang monde the french word for world blood  based in the huge mansion close to picturesque wentworth lake she bought the 13000 sq ft home for $1525 million in 2015 the real estate listing at the time called it a custom built recently improved eight master suite home which included a lovely 4 room au pair suite a fabulous gourmet kitchen with marble counter tops 2 islands large walk in pantry and stainless steel appliances a cherry paneled library an amazing home theater room beautiful marble baths gleaming hardwood floors and all the amenities you would expect from a home of this quality and caliber but the house was trashed by the sheer number of dogs kept by blueblooded fay  whose grandmother married famed financier ef hutton when she was 28 and he was 60 and following huttons death went on to become a viscountess after marrying a member of the british cabinet fay told judge charles greenhalgh that she had the means  and the ability  to indulge her passion for the dogs she said she had adopted six children at birth all of whom had problems resulting from drug or alcohol abuse by their mothers and had spent her life around horses so once her children had grown she decided to start importing european great danes  which she described as 180 lb black labs in disguise  and selling them they are dear loving dedicated loyal dogs that just want to be loved and to love fay said she said the dogs suffer from a lot of health problems and have an average life expectancy of only around six years although occasionally they can live to eight or nine but she expressly denied the house was filthy when her attorney kent barker produced photos and videos of the dogs appearing happy she denied that dirt on the walls and floors was feces it is mud they brought in from outside she said before adding that the walls were cleaned daily at a previous hearing in october teenage worker annierose newell told the court that the conditions at fays home were shocking i felt horrible for the dogs that had to live in those conditions newell 17 said according to the concord monitor  newell had got a job at fays mansion hoping to fulfill her wish to work with animals but she quit after just one day because of the conditions the dogs were kept in she said the great danes constantly slipped on the floors because of the layer of feces that coated them they often jumped on fays bed with their filthy feet everything that was on the floor was being transferred onto her bed she said newell said even had problems staying upright herself because of the floor was so slick it was like an ice rink according to the conway daily sun  maggots infested the chicken pieces kept in the refrigerator newell added maggots just poured out from the door and down on to the ground the teen said adding that the fay family had offered to let her eat her lunch with them in the house but i decided to go to my car she said i could not eat anything that day i had to do all i could to help with the dogs i am not a person whos prone to crying or emotions newell added but i immediately just started crying i couldnt breathe newell took photos on her single day on the job and handed them over to the humane society of the united states beginning the process which ended with fay being charged a second kennel worker marilyn kelly told the court in october that the situation at the house on warren sands road in wolfeboro was out of control she said at one point she could not work because she injured her back lifting a dead dog kelly complained to fays veterinarian kate battenfelder who instead of helping immediately reported back to fay said kelly that created quite a scene said kelly who said fay was furious with her battenfelder whose practice in bartlett new hampshire is a 90minute drive from fays home has invoked her fifth amendment rights to prevent her being called as a witness for the defense but at tuesdays hearing fay defended the veterinarian i have complete trust in her and great respect for her she said in her statement taken at the time of the raid on fays house kelly said she had seen fay stapled a dogs wound without antibiotics after it got involved in a fight she said dogs that are prescribed medications are rarely given the medication for the directed time and only get it for one to two days at most there are dogs with open sores from happy tail where the tail hits the kennel and cuts open and doesnt heal wrote strauch she advised that one room is covered in blood from 8 dogs that have the condition kelly said the dogs were only let out of their cages where they had no water for 15 minutes a day they were fed just once a day there are no windows and no interaction the room burns your eyes from the urine more than half the dogs in the house have liquid stool and it is common to see them vomiting as well in her statement the teenage newell told wolfeboro cop michael strauch of her disgust at the conditions she discovered in the isolated 8bed 13bath mansion newell had been recruited by kennel manager julia smith the police file revealed on her only day at work may 2 she was horrified by what she found and immediately started taking pictures on her phone which are now being used as evidence against fay newell  who was referred to in the police report only by her initials as she was just 16 at the time  told police as soon as she went to fays home on warren sands road in wolfeboro she was met by a smell which made her want to gag she told strauch there were piles of trash and empty boxes covered in chicken juice there were maggots and bugs covering the floor where some of the dogs were living additionally an said that while loading trash bags to bring outside julia told an she didnt like one of the trash bags they were loading because it contained a dead puppy she told an that they used to bury the dead dogs but they dont anymore wrote strauch in his report once inside the house an stated that it was hard to walk as the feces and urine had created a thick layer on the floors an advised the dogs had a hard time standing as well the teen  who had experience working with animals as she lived on an alpaca farm  said she was shocked by the area where chicken for the dogs was prepared the counters were covered in old chicken parts and chicken juice was running off the counter on to the floor wrote strauch the buckets that were used for feeding were not cleaned out from previous feedings there was also a meat grinder on the counter that was not clean newell who was paid $80 for her one day of work told cops she saw dogs defecating on the floor inside the house while unconcerned fay watched them an counted at least 25 great danes in one room alone wrote strauch many other rooms were filled with dogs but fay kept her favorite dogs in her bedroom strauchs report revealed in fays bedroom the dogs were on the bed and there were feces everywhere in the master bedroom there was a litter of great dane puppies they were so young that their eyes hadnt yet opened when julia smith took newell to the hot and stuffy basement she told the teen the dogs needed to go out today because they didnt go out yesterday and they only get water when they go outside an saw many dogs with severely swollen legs and feet and one dog that had such bad cherry eye that it couldnt see an advised they let the dogs out and all they wanted to do was drink puddle water at tuesdays hearing fay said that cherry eye is a condition common to european great danes that is not serious and can often be left untreated \n",

      " senate judiciary committee chair chuck grassley said tuesday that he believed appointing a second special counsel to investigate issues related to hillary clinton  would bring about more independence and credibility the reason i asked for special counsel is because the extent to which mueller was head of the fbi at the time of the uranium one stuff and hes special counsel in the trump russia investigation grassley said on fox  friends grassley was echoing comments made by other republican lawmakers urging the justice department to bring on a special counsel to look into whether donations to the clinton foundation swayed a 2010 obama administration decision to allow a russian company to buy uranium reserves in the united states because mueller was head of the fbi at the time rep jim jordan an ohio republican charged that he surely seems a bit compromised for not going after clinton back then  more articulately wording the argument grassley made today on monday fox news broke the story that attorney general jeff sessions had directed senior federal prosecutors to look into certain issues that congressional republicans have become interested in including a uranium deal secretary clinton signed off on and dealings related to the clinton foundation this move opens the door to the appointment of another special counsel as the justice department answered letters written on july 27 and september 26 from house judiciary committee chairman rep bob goodlatte a virginia republican making such a request robert mueller the former fbi director was tapped in may by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein to investigate ties between president trump and russia after the kremlin meddled in the 2016 presidential campaign while the fbi under former director james comey investigated clinton last year looking into her handling of classified information once it came out that she was using a private server as secretary of state grassley agreed with fox  friends host steve doocy that a number of other things should be examined doocy noted the uranium deal payforplay at the clinton foundation the unmasking of american citizens on intelligence reports and the dossier which clintons campaign partially financed along with leaking information to the media as valid tentacles of where another clintonthemed investigation could go grassley agreed it would include all of those but then grassley told the host to look at it from the 50000foot level i said it isnt about clinton it isnt about trump and russia what all this is about is political interference within the justice department whether its under republican presidents or under democrat presidents grassley said telling the fox news host what he told a democratic senate colleague its the responsibility of the judiciary committee to investigate it he added touting the committee he runs grassley then pointed to evidence he saw of a politicized justice department including former attorney general loretta lynchs tarmac meeting with expresident bill clinton which occurred during the fbis investigation into his wife the iowa republican also pointed to the press conference comey gave in july 2016 where the former top fbi official said the fbi wouldnt recommend charging clinton though called her email use extremely careless grassley said comey in that instance had assumed prosecutorial decision from the attorney general comey testifying before the senate judiciary committee in may had explained to lawmakers that he decided to hold such a press conference because lynchs tarmac meeting with the former president had called into question the credibility of the hillary clinton probe going forward grassley said hed be happy to see a special counsels or justice department officials look into the clinton issues if its going on within the department of justice and people that arent that had anything to do with it at that time or werent close to the leadership of the department of justice or the fbi if they can carry it on im satisfied with that the iowa republican told fox  friends attorney general sessions is testifying before the house judiciary committee today and will likely face questions about his decision to point federal prosecutors in clintons direction as he told grassley during his confirmation hearing that comments hes made about the former democratic presidential nominee could place my objectivity in question i believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kinds of investigations that involve hillary clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it sessions told members of the senate judiciary committee in january since then hes had a rocky relationship with trump who was angered that sessions recused himself from all things russia which put rosenstein in the position to appoint mueller during a november 2 radio interview  trump bemoaned the fact that it would be inappropriate for him to order the justice department to look into clinton again but you know the saddest thing because im the president of the united states i am not supposed to be involved with the justice department i am not supposed to be involved with the fbi trump said in an interview with wmals larry oconnor im not supposed to be doing the kinds of things i would love to be doing and im very frustrated by it the president added \n",

      " an antiques dealer has been found guilty of supplying guns and ammo to gangsters which were later used in several murders and over 100 shootings across britain paul edmunds 65 from hardwicke gloucestershire was dubbed the breaking bad of the gun world after he altered outofdate calibres to bring them back into use in an armoury in his garage they were supplied to dr mohinder surdhar 57 from handsworth birmingham who then sold them on to the criminal underworld the weapons and ammunition have been directly linked to crimes across nine police forces including murders attempted murders and the 2011 birmingham riots when shots were fired at the west midlands police helicopter the sole benefit for both men was money the prosecution proved at trial that edmunds had unexplained deposits of more than £350000 edmunds imported huge quantities of antique and other firearms from the usa over a sixyear period and was also responsible for manufacturing specialist ammunition to fit the handguns following his arrest officers discovered edmunds had also falsified entries in his firearms register and damaged tools which he had used to make the ammunition this was in an attempt to remove unique markings to frustrate later scientific examination surdhar pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and ammunitions edmunds was found guilty of conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and ammunitions two counts of perverting the course of justice transferring prohibited weapons possession of prohibited weapons and importing firearms from america he pleaded guilty to exporting ammunition both men will be sentenced at a later date referring to the two defendants detective constable phil rodgers from west midlands police said they were like the breaking bad of the gun world  on the face of it both decent men but using their skills and expertise to provide deadly firearms but this was no tv drama  these were real weapons real bullets real victims their actions have had a devastating impact on communities by fuelling violent crime leading to fear and bloodshed edmunds has an encyclopaedic knowledge of firearms its not an easy task making obsolete calibre bullets to fit antique guns it would have taken several days to make a box of 50 surdhar also had an armoury at his home and we believe edmunds was teaching him the art of bullet making our investigation has undoubtedly prevented many more firearms and countless rounds of ammunition getting into criminal hands and in all likelihood saved lives warren stanier from the cps said these two men used their expertise to exploit the illicit firearms market for financial gain and in doing so put the lives of the general public and police in danger the cps built a compelling case against the defendants using expert evidence provided by the national ballistics intelligence service and the west midlands regional organised crime unit we work with colleagues in the criminal justice system to identify and robustly pursue those involved throughout the supply chain for illegal firearms the removal of edmunds and surdhar from that supply chain has reduced criminals opportunity to source firearms and use them in further serious crimes in october edmunds went on trial accused of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition at birmingham crown court he denied fraudulent evasion of a prohibition or restriction perverting the course of justice and possession of a prohibited firearm a jury of seven men and five women was told that edmunds created the ammo for antique weapons from three armouries at his home he was investigated after the national ballistics intelligence service nabis noticed an increasing number of prewar handguns at crime scenes nabis managed to arrest and convict an organised crime gang involved in supplying the firearms with the speciallymade ammunition experts realised tool markings on the ammunition matched those they had recovered over several years and collated as operation gold dust opening the case prosecutor andrew fisher qc said this case concerns the supply of guns and live ammunition to criminal gangs both in the west midlands and across the country in march 2014 the police mounted an operation in an attempt to apprehend both those who supplied the guns and those who possessed them the firearms experts at nabis had noticed that since 2009 an increasing number of police recoveries were of prewar handguns for which there was no commercially available ammunition most of these recoveries were specially made ammunition for these guns and examinations showed that much of this ammunition had been manufactured using the same equipment microscopic examinations enabled them to see telltale tool markings on the ammunition rather like fingerprints which all matched therefore it appeared that the same person or manufacturer was supplying the specially made or adapted ammunition that was recovered from over 100 crime scenes throughout the country as you can imagine there was an extensive search for not just the people who had these firearms but the person supplying them and the ammunition operation cookie was launched in 2014 and since then a number of people have been arrested and have been convicted the court heard how the weapons had been passed to gang leader nosakhere stephenson through middleman mohinder surdhar who liaised with chief armourer sundish nazran mr fisher added it is now clear that mohinder surdhar was supplying to the organised crime group that i have just told you about however dr surdhars dealings were exclusively with the gangs chief armourer sundish nazran surdhar obtained the guns from various sources including mr edmunds and the specially made or adapted ammunition from edmunds these weapons were then used in several fatal shootings and the shooting at a police helicopter during the london riots of 2011 initially mr edmunds was approached by the police them having found an invoice of his amongst surdhars papers as you can imagine his premises were then searched it was found that he had made numerous false entries into his register to cover his tracks and many of the firearms were not listed his business was run from home the principal armoury was his garage and this was already known to and regularly inspected by the authorities but police searches found a further armoury in his bedroom where he undertook some of the modifications and a third one in the attic it was found that the specially made or adapted ammunition recovered by the police in the 100 plus recoveries from crime scenes matched ammunition found at edmunds house there were many tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and component parts it was found that he had a recipe book which tells him what the main ingredients are for any calibre of ammunition that he wants to make plainly he has an expertise and almost encyclopaedic knowledge of firearms and ammunition he has been supplying guns and ammunition highly unlawfully for many years jurors were told how further searches of edmunds home revealed he had been importing hundreds of guns from the united states paying around £250000 mr fisher said he then failed to list them on his firearms register meaning they could not be traced he added he managed to get round this regulation including costs and taxes in order to make it cheaper for him but more relevantly easier to supply to the illicit market on examination of his registers it became clear that of the hundreds of guns he had imported very few had been recorded in his register these guns and ammunition were not found on his property meaning that they must have been sold the failure to mark them in his stock record made it easier for him to supply them to the illicit market no record no trace these guns together with the ammunition have inevitably gone almost directly into the hands of dangerous criminals since they could not in reality be lawfully held by anyone other than the firearms dealer the court also heard edmunds may have made up to £375000 as a result of selling on the guns and ammo mr fisher said it was also found that £300000 was paid into his many card accounts under the heading credit and £75000 was paid into other accounts again through cash it would appear that unknown sources have funded mr edmunds activities to the tune of £375000 this may reflect some of his criminal activity in supplying firearms and ammunition illicitly to people who should not and are not permitted to have them

      " in his travels across asia president donald trump offered himself as a sharp break from presidents past he pushed regional leaders to reshape trade deals to americas liking opted against spotlighting human rights abuses and cranked up pressure on north korea to end its nuclear program but for all the pageantry and promises unfurled during his fivenation 12day trip trump returns to washington with few concrete accomplishments in hand and leaves uncertain asian capitals in his wake the president pushed a goitalone trade policy yet reaffirmed traditional alliances he cajoled and flattered leaders in tokyo and seoul without eliciting firm commitments for a more balanced economic relationship he opened the door to negotiations with north korea but such diplomatic overtures were overshadowed by a tweet that derided dictator kim jong un as short and fat and as regional allies nervously watched for trump to define the new us approach to the pacific rim the president muddied his message at a summit in vietnam he vowed to hold rising superpower china accountable for unfair business and trade practices yet in beijing the president said i dont blame china for a growing trade gap trumps unscripted decision to publicly denounce the policies of his predecessors while flattering his asian hosts underlined his unconventional international approach one centered on personal rapport and strategic commitments while paying little attention to the guardrails that have long defined us foreign policy in the white house view trump accomplished what he set out to do strengthen relationships with world leaders and lay the groundwork for more equitable economic relationships the president soaked in the lavish welcome ceremonies at each stop and dubbed the trip tremendously successful i think the fruits of our labor are going to be incredible whether its the security of our nations whether its security of the world or whether its trade trump said before leaving the philippines on tuesday bound for home trump said hed have more to say about the trip with a major statement at the white house this week but across the pacific trump was reminded of the challenges awaiting him at home as trump and xi wrapped up their joint statements to the press in beijing they ignored shouted questions from american reporters in the great hall of the people when they ducked backstage xi summoned his interpreter and posed an inquiry to trump who is roy moore xi asked that moment described by two white house officials who werent authorized to speak publicly about private conversations underscores trumps domestic challenges he must grapple with the uncertain fate of his tax cut plan face the threat of a government shutdown and decide whether to cut ties with moore the republican candidate in alabamas special senate race who is accused of sexually assaulting underage girls decades ago for most of the trip trump was able to leave domestic affairs behind though he did reignite the russia firestorm by revealing that president vladimir putin had insisted to him in vietnam that moscow didnt hack the 2016 election trump added and i believe  i really believe  that when he tells me that he means it trump later clarified that he was with the us intelligence agencies that concluded russia was behind the interference in seoul trump delivered a sharp warning to north korea saying do not underestimate us and do not try us but he also for the first time signaled a willingness to negotiate with kim though he didnt elaborate just as vital as the message trump delivered to pyongyang was the one he sent to china which supplies most of north koreas economic lifeblood his message to beijing its time to do more at each stop on his trip trump both bemoaned the current state of us trade relations in the region and announced new business deals including more than $250 billion in china but most of those agreements were older already agreedupon or only promises in vietnam he scolded china for unfair trade practices and delivered a forceful advocacy for bilateral trade deals only to have 11 nations strike a multinational agreement hours later breaking with previous presidents trump largely abandoned publicly pressing foreign leaders on human rights he said nothing about restrictions on civil liberties or press freedoms in china and vietnam and most notably did not rebuke philippine president rodrigo duterte for overseeing a violent drug war that features extrajudicial killings senate minority leader chuck schumer called trumps trip a flop he seemed far more interested in pomp and circumstance  red carpets fancy meals and the flattery of foreign leaders  than advancing american interests in a region that is increasingly looking to china for leadership schumer dny said monday and after the presidents performance those countries are going to turn more to china at least they have strength and direction even though china will take advantage of them for sure as they have taken advantage of us ever the showman trump reveled in the imagery of the trip including a sunset private tour of beijings forbidden city golf with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and lavish state dinners but he was denied the dramatic moment he desired trump planned a secret visit to the demilitarized zone at the heavily fortified korean border but

      " a motherofnine and her violent boyfriend have been jailed for a total of 21 and a half years after she did nothing as her fivemonthold son died from a catastrophic brain injury inflicted by her partner danny shepherd 26 lost his temper with the young baby while katherine cox 33 knowing the risk her son was in did nothing to protect him despite knowing the risk he posed cox was jailed for eight years and shepherd who still denies responsibility for 13andahalf years a staggering 28 injuries to 19 of his bones were discovered after he died in april last year a court heard they were between 10 days and nine weeks old and a pathologist concluded they were sustained by the tot being twisted pulled crushed and bent in half passing sentence mr justice stuartsmith said he accepted cox had not inflicted any of the injuries or been present at the time but added she knew the risk shepherd posed and put her life with him before the safety of her child he said i am sure that it was you danny shepherd who inflicted the injuries that killed eli you continue to deny it but you know its true i am also sure it was you who inflicted the earlier injuries in normal speech you lost it as you had lost it before but you lost it majorly and inflicted serious violence upon eli causing his death all of this could have been avoided had you just stayed away from him having lost it on previous occasions he added for much of his life eli would have been in pain from the fractures you inflicted he was particularly vulnerable as he could do nothing to protect himself or draw attention to his suffering you knew what you had done in the past and you knew you were in danger of doing it again in your case katherine cox i am sure that you didnt inflict the injuries and i am not sure you took part in or were present when he inflicted the earlier injuries but i am sure that you knew that danny shepherd caused significant injuries to eli and that there was a risk he would do it again it is one of the shocking features of this case that you put your infatuation with danny shepherd before the safety of your baby you bear a heavy responsibility for what happened to eli you have lost everything fractures and bone damage were found in nine of elis ribs as well as his neck spine right arm right thighbone and shinbone and left shinbone his thighbone had been broken at both ends and two fractures in his neck were compared to a whiplash injury usually suffered in car crashes an expert concluded elis injuries were caused by very significant force and could not have been caused even during boisterous play both cox and shepherd denied causing or allowing the death of a child and causing or allowing serious physical harm to a child at a trial earlier this year they were unanimously convicted of the charges as well as possessing amphetamine five small bags of the class b drug were found in a vanish tub in a garden shed at their home in minster on sea sheerness kent by police the couple claimed not to use drugs but tests revealed shepherd had used amphetamine on the day eli was taken ill and cox had been occasionally exposed to both amphetamine and cocaine traces of the same two drugs were also discovered in the babys hair after his death the court also heard that a shocking photograph emerged of eli with tape over his mouth the prosecution said this and the exposure to drugs demonstrated a blatant and deliberate disregard by cox and shepherd for the babys welfare mr justice stuartsmith added eli was being raised in a highly dysfunctional and chaotic environment after their trial kent county council confirmed a serious case review was under way to establish if elis death could have been prevented by the authorities the tot stopped breathing after shepherd who was not elis natural father put him in his cot for a nap at about 530pm on april 13 last year a court heard his collapse from extensive brain damage was caused by either shaking or shaking combined with impact from which the effect would have been immediate and obvious shepherd lost his temper and hit elis head on a musical projector toy attached to the cot two small circular bruises were later found on the back of his head which matched buttons on the toy the court also heard eli may have still been in the womb when first exposed to drugs and could have later ingested them through a contaminated baby bottle the couple denied hurting him either deliberately or accidentally after their arrests shepherd who kept a beating stick at the fourbedroomed house in lapwing close claimed a cousin who looked after eli two days before he collapsed was heavyhanded with him bizarrely cox told hospital staff a 999 operator had told them to hang eli upside down and shake him to resuscitate him but maidstone crown court in kent was told that as neighbours and paramedics battled to resuscitate the lifeless baby shepherd was overheard saying ill get the blame for this shell blame me cox whose harrowing emergency call was played during their fourweek trial was said to be hysterical and using shepherds nickname shouted pickle what have you done witnesses who tried to save the tots life told the court the couple were reluctant to join eli in the ambulance and delayed its leaving for hospital the youngster was subsequently put on a life support machine at kings college hospital in london but his condition deteriorated and he died on april 27 several nurses spoke of how cox who is known as kathy was often on her phone while her son was in intensive care fighting for his life one even had to tell cox to stop using her phone as her sons life support was being switched off another said although cox seemed to be crying a lot there were no actual tears prosecutor jennifer knight told the court at the start of their trial that one was the perpetrator and the other did nothing to stop what was going on danny shepherd and katherine cox were the only adults present in the house at the time and it was the actions of one of them that resulted in the catastrophic brain injury that eli cox suffered said miss knight but the events that day were the unhappy culmination of injuries eli had suffered over many weeks also inflicted by danny shepherd or katherine cox both were aware of events leading up to april 13 and on the day itself that eli was at serious risk of physical harm because one of them was the perpetrator and the other knew that the perpetrator posed a risk to eli one of them did it and the other did nothing about it shepherd began a relationship with cox when she was halfway through her pregnancy and they moved in together just days before eli was born on november 27 2015 nadine radford qc defending told the court he was a young inexperienced man who naively took on the family since being convicted he has been attacked in prison before his collapse eli was said to be healthy growing well and gaining weight friends also described how eli had been smiling happy and playing just hours before he suffered his fatal brain injury shepherd later told police eli was whingeing as he always does when he put him in his cot to sleep using a plastic baby in his video recorded interview with police shepherd demonstrated how he patted elis back to ensure he was not choking after finding him turning blue with froth oozing from his nose he said his resuscitation attempts could have fractured elis ribs but he denied knowing about any other bone injuries spinal damage in the small of elis back was described as a crush injury caused by bending him in half a similar bending of elis head backwards and forwards caused two fractures to upper neck vertebrae comparable to car crash whiplash evidence of fractures caused by twisting pulling or both were found in elis right upper arm right femur and both shinbones the couple moved to faversham in kent after eli died shepherd described cox as an excellent mother while cox said her boyfriend was a super dad cox who has an iq of 75 chose not to give evidence to the jury but she told police after her arrest i just want the truth for my little boy he didnt deserve this oliver saxby qc defending said coxs treatment by other prisoners had been brutal the offence of causing or allowing the death of a child was introduced to cover those cases where there is not enough evidence to prove which defendant is responsible for murder manslaughter or assault senior investigating officer detective chief inspector ivan beasley of kent police said the death of a child is never anything less than tragic but the circumstances behind eli coxs passing are especially upsetting for those of us who share a compassion for others none of us will ever understand what compels people to cause harm to children and it is unfortunately true to say that eli suffered more than most and was robbed of his life before it had barely begun katherine cox and danny shepherd maintained their innocence throughout but the jury saw through their lies only they know the true extent of the abuse eli was put through which is simply unthinkable to most members of society including parents who would do anything to protect their children from harm i strongly advise anyone who suspects a child is being neglected to call us on 101 or contact the nspcc on 0808 800 5000 children who are being abused themselves can call childline for support and advice on 0800 1111 \n",

what she said i did i dont even know the woman moore told abc 33 on monday night with his wife by his side i dont know anything about her i dont even know where the restaurant is or was moore then added that the claim he attempted to rape a then16yearold beverly young nelson was a political maneuver which had nothing to do with reality back in washington dc on tuesday speaker of the house paul ryan joined his senate counterpart mitch mcconnell and said that moores accusers seemed credible and the senate hopeful should step down scroll down for videos kayla also chimed in at the last second news conference to say that he husband had never one time lifted a finger against me in their 32 years of marriage these things are false and its ugly its the ugliest politics ive ever been in in my life said kayla she made that statement just hours after she stated beverlys lawyer gloria allred was on a quest to advance transgender rights by representing the victim in a facebook post her husbands campaign went a step further by stating allred was on a witch hunt and responsible for the murder of millions of babies  gloria allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt and she is only around to create a spectacle said a statement on released by the moore campaign on monday allred was the attorney who claims credit for giving us roe v wade which has resulted in the murder of tens of millions of unborn babies kayla meanwhile wrote a lengthy post defending her husband we knew something was coming just did not know what next this is the same gloria allred that did the very exact same thing to trump during his campaign wrote kayla going on two months now theyve been on a witchhunt here in etowah county and our state advertising people to step forward with accusations and we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward which is part of why we are filing suit kayla then said washington establishment and democrat party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign she closed out by telling her followers prayers appreciated a few hours later she posted a photo of allred in a parade holding a sign that read i support transgender equality and wrote gloria allred what its really about this comes after kayla posted a letter from 50 pastors showing their support for moore over the weekend without noting that it was obtained in august leading two of the individuals who signed to come forward and demand that their names be removed beverly said in an emotional press conference on monday that she first met moore when he was district attorney and she was a high school student who was waiting tables at the olde hickory house she was just 15 at the time and soon after she turned 16 moore then 31 offered beverly a ride home one cold winter night she said which was the night of the alleged incident beverly said that after getting in the car moore drove her to the back of the parking lot and pulled up next to a dumpster where he parked and then began to grope beverlys breasts she said that she asked him to stop and that when she tried to get out of the vehicle he locked the door and grabbed her neck in an attempt to pull her head down towards his crotch moore abruptly called a news conference in gallant alabama after a tearful beverly young nelsons detailed the new allegations to reporters in new york i can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false i never did what she said i did i dont even know the woman moore said  even though he allegedly signed her yearbook i got into his car in the passenger seat he began driving i thought he would get on the highway but instead he drove to the back of the restaurant said beverly of the night she was allegedly assaulted by moore i was not immediately alarmed as there was an exit from the back of the restaurant to the street and he could drive from there to my house without getting on the highway however instead of driving to the street he stopped the car and parked his car in between the dumpster and the back of the restaurant where there were no lights the area was dark and deserted i was alarmed and i immediately asked him what he was doing moore at that point said nothing and began to grope beverly she claimed a story she previously shared with her mother and then man who is now her husband instead of answering my question mr moore reached over and began groping me putting his hands on my breasts said beverly i tried to open my car door to leave but he reached over and locked it so i could not get out i tried fighting him off while yelling at him to stop but instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch i continued to struggle i was determined that i was not allow him to force me to have sex with him i was terrified he was also trying to pull my shirt off i thought that he was going to rape me i was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop i had tears running down my face beverly was able to get out of the car soon after claiming moore told her to keep quiet because no one would believe her if she did share her story he said youre just a child and he said i am the district attorney of etowah county and if you tell anyone about this no one will ever believe you her boyfriend who was initially supposed to pick her up but had been running late pulled up to the restaurant soon after beverly made her way out of the vehicle i did not say anything to him as to what had occurred as he had a violent temper and i was afraid that he would do something that would get him into trouble when i got home i went to my room explained beverly the following morning my neck was black and blue and purple in the days following i covered the bruising on my neck with makeup i did not tell anyone about what had happened i was scared she then added i felt that if i told anyone mr moore would do something to me or my family i decided to keep what happened to myself and she also found a way to avoid moore the day after mr moore assaulted me i called the restaurant and quit my job i never went there again said beverly then shortly after she began sharing her story about two years later i told my younger sister what mr moore did to me said beverly about four years ago i told my mother what happened before i married my husband john i told him what mr moore had done to me her attorney gloria allred said at the top of the press conference that beverly would be willing to testify under oath in front of the us senate ahead of moore possibly joining their ranks we urge the united states senate judiciary committee to hold a public hearing as soon as possible said allred beverly is willing to voluntarily appear at such a hearing to testify under oath she is willing to answer any questions that the senators might ask her relevant to her allegations against mr moore and after a number of accusers were shredded apart because of their political affiliations beverly very plainly stated that both she and her husband were supporters of president donald trump in the last election allred also dismissed claims that she might be politically motivated in her decision to represent beverly i would point out that i did not contact beverly she contacted me further i have a public record of attacking democrats who are or have been elected officials when they have been accused of injustices against women said allred before beverly shared her story for example i filed a lawsuit against democratic mayor bob filner of san diego and publicly accused him of sexually harassing the citys communications director as a result of the mediation of our lawsuit mayor filner resigned as mayor she also pointed out that she publicly criticized both anthony weiner and bill clinton in the past this latest accuser proved to be the most damaging yet however and soon after her press conference senator john cornyn of texas withdrew his support of moore calling the allegations damaging and disqualifying if in fact true this came after a devastating statement from the highestranking republican in the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was blunt and to the point with his assessment even before the press conference on monday stating i believe the women he went on to tell reporters that moore should step aside which led to moore responding with a vitriolic post on social media the person who should step aside is mitch mcconnell he has failed conservatives and must be replaced draintheswamp said moore maine senator susan collins also weighed in and once again proved she had no issue bucking her partys trend i have now read mr moores statement and listened to his radio interview in which he denies the charges she wrote on twitter i did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the senate race in alabama it remains to be seen if beverly will be called to testify but she thanked those four women who came before her during her press conference on monday revealing that they gave her the greatest gift i thought that i was mr moores only victim i would probably have taken what mr moore did to me to my grave had it not been for the courage of four other women that were willing to speak out about their experiences with mr moore explained beverly while drying her eyes with a tissue their courage has inspired me to overcome my fear one woman told the washington post that moore initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was 32 three others said moore pursued them when they were 18 or younger an emotionally exhausted beverly managed to summarize the entire incident in a few lines to close out the conference mr moore attacked me when i was a child i did nothing to deserve his sexual attack said beverly i was frightened by his position and his power i am coming forward to let mr moore know that he no longer has any power over me and i no longer live in fear of him \n",

      " michele lent hirsch was 16 when the twin towers fell on september 11 2001 four blocks from her high school in downtown manhattan  she can remember seeing the first tower fall from her window at 959am then feeling the whole building shake when the second tower fell 29 minutes later as she and her classmates huddled in a stairwell even now accessing those traumatic memories is painful but ptsd is not the only thing michele and her classmates were left with in 2010 at the age of 25 michele was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer  which is typically caused by radiation exposure and the federal government has officially recognized that it was caused by 911 michele now 32 is one of many children and residents of battery park the financial district and tribeca who are not often thought of as the classic candidates for 911related diseases with most coverage focused on first responders and the people who worked in the offices but while she does fall into that bracket she did not know she was eligible for federallyfunded cancer treatment until she was almost in remission  and she claims she is hardly the only one i went through all of my cancer treatment and i didnt know that i could access federally funded care until very late in the game michele told daily mail online i had my thyroid removed in an incredibly painful surgery and i had radioactive iodine treatment in 2011 which was unspeakably bad i luckily had insurance through a good job but i found out later through a friend from high school that i was eligible for mount sinais world trade center healthcare program which funds treatment for 911related illnesses i had thought that only first responders had access to things like that there are tons of students and teachers and people who lived and worked downtown who should know that they are eligible michele is sharing her story as dozens of children teachers and bereaved families from various schools around ground zero file claims against the city for failing to protect them from cancerous toxins then failing to provide wellpublicized support rates of papillary thyroid cancer increased about 10 percent in communities in the wake of the atomic bombs in japan and after chernobyl now researchers are seeing the same in new yorks socalled cancer cluster micheles cancer was symptomless she went for her annual primary care checkup when she was 25 and her doctor who had recently seen another patient diagnosed with thyroid cancer decided to feel her neck she said oh theres a lump which is something you never want to hear eventually it was confirmed that i had several tumors michele recalled mine had spread to my lymph nodes so it was a more aggressive variation than the doctors would have liked to see while thyroid cancer is more common in white females than any other demographic it typically affects people in their 40s and older the average fiveyear survival rate is 90 percent for all forms of thyroid cancer and can be closer to 100 percent for young sufferers since it is slowgrowing however the treatments to beat the disease and prevent it spreading to the lungs or brain or liver are grueling michele underwent a heavyduty operation in 2011 at the age of 26 to remove her thyroid a butterflyshaped gland at the base of the voice box which is essential for hormone regulation metabolism and body heat the operation takes at least two hours under general anesthesia carefully extracting the gland from the nerves and vessels patients then require two days of supervision in hospital and will need thyroid replacement drugs for life to ensure all the cancer cells are blitzed most patients  especially those whose cancer has spread  are advised to get radioactive iodine treatment the procedure involves ingesting a radioactive form of iodine iodine 131 which sweeps through the body the cancerinfected thyroid cells consume the iodine which kills them essentially it turns the patient radioactive for a few days and they remain in quarantine throughout it was horrible michele says already feeling alone as a 20something with cancer the isolation and fear took a severe emotional toll now six years later michele is in remission though she adds that its very nervewracking every single time she gets a checkup and her care is paid for by the federallyfunded program getting enrolled she was also surprised to find she could get free therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder i really needed it we all need it but i hadnt really thought about it until they offered it to me she says its one of the most traumatizing things that i have ever been through its hard to talk about everyone at my school was traumatized by what happened i had definitely not dealt with it until they had given me that free therapy officially the world trade center health registry recognizes 70 cancers as being linked to the toxic cocktail of fumes from ground zero including pulverized concrete jet fuel and mercury it also recognizes gerd every lung disease sleep apnea sinusitis depression asthma and ptsd mark farfel director of the world trade center health registry estimates around 400000 responders and civilians are at risk of 911related illnesses as of last year mount sinais world trade center health program had counted more than 5400 people with 911related cancers alone not counting the other illnesses but michael barasch a lawyer representing more than a dozen former students insists the city did not do enough to protect and treat his clients announcing his cases last week he said a 28yearold girl should have not breast cancer a 29yearold boy should not have colon cancer or bladder cancer michele who is not currently represented by barasch agrees i do know that various parents were debating whether it was safe for us to go back to school and we were worried about it too but the school said to come back so we did she recalls the smell i can remember the smell very strongly it had a very strong noxious odor that smelled like bad chemical and i do remember it making me very concerned but when youre 16  or even some kids were 13 or 14  you dont have agency you have to go to school if you want to graduate from that school with good grades and have a chance of going to college so if they say its time to go to school you go obviously now we know that was probably the wrong decision

      " by megan rowling bonn germany nov 14 thomson reuters foundation  germany on tuesday pledged $125 million to boost the work of an international insurance partnership that aims to cover 400 million more poor and vulnerable people against disaster risks by 2020 that goal was first set in 2015 by the g7 group of wealthy nations but the effort has now been expanded to bring in other partners including the world bank and an alliance of about 50 countries vulnerable to climate threats including small island states like fiji which is presiding over the talks in bonn in july britain contributed 30 million pounds $394 million to establish a centre for global disaster protection fijis prime minister frank bainimarama said that when powerful cyclone winston hit his nation last year wiping out 30 percent of its economy tens of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed and many households were uninsured people protected by their wealth have no idea of the heartbreak of the poor and most vulnerable when they lose their homes and livelihoods in climaterelated disasters he told an event to launch the partnership fiji needs new forms of finance to develop while also reducing the risks of weather extremes and rising seas to tourism forests fisheries and agriculture as well as to infrastructure much of which is exposed on the coast he said the insuresilience global partnership will develop and roll out innovative finance and insurance solutions for individual countries tailored to the needs and challenges of their poor people in particular it said those will include sovereign risk pools like the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility ccrif which has paid out $62 million to 10 caribbean countries since hurricanes irma and maria brought destruction to the island states in september using the additional funds announced tuesday on the sidelines of the un climate talks in bonn the global partnership will also aim to expand schemes such as the nwk agriservices cotton company in zambia which offers weather and life insurance to small contract farmers and is already backed by insuresilience in 2015 some 52000 farmers bought insurance of whom more than 23000 received payments after a major drought in 2016 allen chastanet prime minister of st lucia said the ccrif had proved to be an amazing asset enabling quick access to funds after a disaster but it was just as important to provide money to help caribbean nations adapt to climate change to help prevent catastrophic losses he said insurance is not dealing with the overall solution it is dealing with the symptom not the actual cause he said aid agencies working in developing countries to reduce the risks of disasters said the partnership must also look at ways to help vulnerable communities prepare better for climate threats besides providing insurance insurance doesnt actually reduce risk and it could be unaffordable for the communities its meant to cover said tracy carty head of oxfams delegation at the bonn conference no other choice ibrahim thiaw deputy executive director of un environment said the expansion of insurance could help bring down its costs as has happened in africa with mobile phones which are now almost everywhere insurance is booming around climate it will grow because people have no other choice they need that buffer to protect themselves he told a separate discussion the group of climatevulnerable countries working with insuresilience including bangladesh ethiopia and costa rica are also working on their own schemes such as the planned sustainable insurance and takaful facility which is based on the principles of islamic finance it aims to close the gaps in insurance protection and disaster risk reduction for its member states 1 billion people only 14 percent of whom have access to some form of risk cover members would contribute to a fund that pays out when a disaster hits as well as supporting adaptation and green projects said sara jane ahmed of the institute for climate and sustainable cities the facility aims to start work next year this week the un climate change secretariat also launched an online platform under the paris climate agreement that will use artificial intelligence to connect countries seeking innovative insurance solutions with the expertise they need un climate chief patricia espinosa said the new efforts would bring together those working to prevent climate disasters and help allay damage across the international community failing to plan for climate impacts is a huge risk she said noting how hurricane irma had recently left barbuda uninhabited for the first time in 300 years while persistent drought is displacing people in africas sahel region contributing to the migration

      " on tuesday alabama gop senate candidate roy moore made light of the claims that he molested a child and tried to rape a 16yearold girl moore who has been accused of assaulting or pursuing five teenagers in the 1970s when he was in his 30s made the remarks at a campaign event at walker springs road baptist church in alabama on tuesday obviously ive made a few people mad im the only one that can unite democrats and republicans because i seem to be opposed by both he said to laughter scroll down for video moore whos now gunning for the senate seat vacated when jeff sessions moved into the white house has been accused by five women of abuse or impropriety the most serious claims include an allegation that he kissed stripped and molested a 14yearold girl and sexually assaulted another girl who had just turned 16 three other women have said that he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his thirties moore has denied all of the claims but admitted to dating teenagers others have said he was infamous for pursuing highschool girls in the 1970s on tuesday moore painted the allegations as a conspiracy by democrats and mainstream republicans to scupper his chances of getting into washington in the december 12 election theyve spent over 30 million dollars trying to take me out he said theyve done everything they can together to keep me from going to washington and why well it has a lot to do with what were talking about tonight we want our country to be saved by god but weve got a part in it if we humble ourselves and pray and seek his face and turn from our wicked ways the former alabama supreme court judge went on to paint himself as an outsider who got into trouble after he tried to force the states judges to not comply with a federal ruling allowing samesex marriage that decision ultimately resulted in his suspension and resignation from the supreme court he vowed to take the truth of god to our capital but only if its gods will if its not gods will i pray that i dont get put in that position if thats not what he wants he said moore might have been preparing a divine escape hatch in the face of strong opposition from dc republicans who are worried that the molestation claims will be his downfall if moore fails to take the seat and democrat opponent doug jones gets in instead the republican majority will drop from 5248 to 5149 that would make passing bills nigh impossible for the gop on tuesday senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who is in allout warfare with moore said the president would weigh in once he returned from asia that day he said hed already spoken about moore to the president vice president mike pence and white house chief of staff john kelly hes obviously not fit to be in the united states senate and weve looked at all the options to try to prevent that from happening said mcconnell who has said he believes moores accusers this close to election its a complicated matter moores attempts to paint his struggle for the seat as a spiritual war will be helped by those republicans who agree with mcconnell  and they are not in short supply attorney general jeff sessions told congress he has no reason to doubt the accusers and hasnt ruled out a senate investigation into moore house speaker paul ryan said if moore cares about the values and people he claims to care about then he should step aside republican arizona senator jeff flake has told the media that he would run to the polling station to vote democrat if he were registered in alabama many others have said that moore should step down if the complaints are true two washington republicans speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations said they didnt know what trump would do but said the white house shares mcconnells concerns about moore while few think trump could persuade moore to step aside several are hoping he can convince the alabama state party to take some action despite the building pressure from national republicans state gop office holders have taken a measured response the 21member party steering committee could vote to revoke moores gop nomination and ask election officials to ignore ballots cast for him election day but that would risk a lawsuit and backlash from moore supporters the party has little interest in alienating moores followers a year before elections in which the governors office and entire state legislature will be in play but it remains possible in an interview moore campaign chairman bill armistead said hed seen no indication the state party will back off in any way he said some in the party want it to pass a resolution embracing moore its also too late to place another republican name on the ballot but its possible to organize a writein campaign backing another republican figure but so fair discussion around that has failed to coalesce into anything practical and no writein candidate has ever won in the state a spokesman for gop governor kay ivey reiterated that she would not postpone the election to give moores opponents more time to organize that would spark a legal challenge but a possible delay remains an option republicans say   \n",

      " des moines iowa ap  as he tows a 96squarefoot house around des moines joe stevens is overwhelmed by the intense sometimes tearful support he receives from churches schools and service groups for his plan to use the trendy little structures to help homeless people but when stevens actually tried to create a village of the homes in iowas largest city the response was far different we got shot down said stevens who leads a group that proposed erecting 50 tiny homes on a 5acre industrial site north of downtown des moines it was a sense of fear uncertainty and doubt a kneejerk situation tiny homes have been promoted as the solution to all kinds of housing needs  shelter for the homeless an affordable option for expensive big cities and simplicity for people who want to declutter their lives but the same popularity that inspired at least six national tv shows about the homes often fails to translate into acceptance when developers try to build them next door in at least a dozen cases across the nation neighbors organized to stop tiny house projects including in charlotte north carolina nashville tennessee san jose california tulsa oklahoma tallahassee florida and bend oregon sometimes the efforts moved ahead despite objections but in many cases the communities were blocked the president of the american tiny house association said opposition arises even among people who feel an affinity for the homes people say tiny home are great and cool and you can put that village anywhere but right across the street from my subdivision said chris galusha who is also a fort worth texas area builder the current interest in small houses follows a steady growth in the median size of homes from 1200 square feet in the 1940s to about 1860 square feet in this decade as home sizes spiraled up tiny house pioneers in the 1990s began promoting the austerity and frugality of spaces smaller than most garages the idea captivated millions of americans even those who remain in more spacious accommodations its an aspirational lifestyle and its fun to watch people try to do something difficult which is to live contrary to the general trend which is more space said ben keys a real estate professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school the opposition is often focused on developments for homeless people as in des moines but in many cases it also extends to tiny home communities designed for the open market thats what happened in charlotte north carolina where a developer had hoped to build 56 tiny homes near a neighborhood filled with ranch houses and splitlevels opponents argued that the tiny homes would clash with existing housing cause traffic problems and fail financially due to the cost of the 500 squarefoot homes which would be priced at about $90000 the tiny houses we feel theyre a fad said robert wilson who helped lead the opposition its a niche market and we think it is not less expensive a similar story unfolded in the highdesert resort city of bend oregon where owners of a development inspired by author jrr tolkeins vision of a middle earth paradise were shocked when they learned of plans for a 22lot tiny home development that would wrap around many existing houses i think tiny homes are great and people can enjoy them if they like but please dont put them in our neighborhood said joanna white wolff who fears existing home values could drop by $100000 if the tiny development proceeds my home is my sanctuary and its going to be destroyed by different thinking wolff and her neighbors are considering legal action to block the development if city leaders approve the plan she said for his project to help the homeless stevens arranged for high school and college students to build the houses with donations to cover costs but after being thwarted in the search for a building site the des moines group he heads called joppa turned to the nearby city of van meter about locating the village there were not giving up because we really do believe this is an answer to a serious problem said stevens who noted that about 250 people are typically homeless in the des moines area the homeless population in san jose california is much larger  an estimated 4000 people that city would like to offer tiny houses as a solution but one middleclass neighborhood has threatened to file a lawsuit people are sympathetic toward the homeless but to put this in an established neighborhood doesnt make sense said jon kanter a retiree who has lived in the neighborhood for nearly 40 years its a comparable situation in nashville where residents went to court to stop the zoning board from approving a churchs plans to build a village of 22 tiny homes for homeless people some homeless advocates also oppose the move to offer tiny houses to homeless people saying the money could be better spent subsidizing their move into traditional apartments in tallahassee florida a privately funded development called the dwellings will open this fall with 11 of an eventual 130 tiny houses intended for homeless people who have some resources residents will pay $550 to $850 a month for homes up to 410 square feet a price that also includes meals and a range of other services before the development could become a reality backers had to give up on plans to locate it within the city because of zoning issues and then successfully fight a lawsuit filed by neighbors tiny home supporters point to successes in madison wisconsin and in seattle and portland and eugene oregon sometimes communities actually seek out tiny home developments although it is rare thats what happened in colorado where pueblobased sprout tiny homes has been building tiny houses and then trucking them to communities that need affordable housing more than 40 of the homes serve as seasonal housing for workers in the exorbitantly expensive resort city of aspen others serve as overnight rentals in the city of lyons near rocky mountain national park the latest effort is a marketrate development of 200 homes on nearly 20 acres in the city of salida company president rod stambaugh said the key to avoiding opposition is to fill a need and take pains to be clear about your intentions you have to have a fullblown plan thats well thought out he said  follow scott mcfetridge on twitter at httpstwittercomsmcfetridge  \n",

has seen some troubles recently which involved his situation at lax airport in october where cocaine was detected on him with series three of the show being confirmed it is unclear whether charlie will be allowed to return to the states for future filming endeavours in a carefully worded statement heaton said he was working to rectify the situation which is said to have occurred after sniffer dogs detected the cocaine on his person my planned travel to the us last week was affected by an issue at us immigration and i am working to rectify it as soon as possible the star told people magazine i do want to clarify that i was not arrested or charged with a crime and cooperated fully with the us officials at lax following the drugs detection charlie was questioned before being sent back to england on a return flight and was unable to attend the premiere for the second season of stranger things im sorry to all the fans and my stranger things family for missing the premiere he said we are all so proud of this season and i would never want this story to negatively impact the show charlies mother and sister previously said a small amount of cocaine found its way on to his wallet at a party two weeks earlier or at a bar or at a shop without his knowledge family of the actor say he has never done drugs in the past and was not under the influence at the time he was stopped at the airport charlie has since undergone tests including a hair and urine sample which have come back all clear according to his family they are now hoping the misunderstanding blows over sooner rather than later to allow the british star and continue filming for stranger things but they have criticised how charlie was treated by us officials claiming he was interrogated for three hours and wasnt allowed to call anyone or ask for a lawyer they blamed his treatment on his tv star status and claim he was used as a target speaking at the family home in bridlington east yorkshire his mother michelle lowe 50 said all that rubbish its completely fabricated i know that but thats all im allowed to say on it hes never done drugs in the past its completely made up thats what papers do im not his agent im just his mum so i cant really say too much he is sort of between here london and america it would be awful if he wasnt allowed back to america to film but i dont see it shouldnt be he has proven his innocence it could happen to any of us you go to a bar or a party its just unfortunate really i know thats what has happened i hope it blows over his sister kayleigh heaton 32 added it could have come from anywhere he wasnt carrying drugs he wasnt high hes had tests and they have come back clear he not got it in his system or anything he was at a party two weeks before and obviously when youre at a party anything can happen you leave your things on the side when youre having a drink it could be that he was at a shop it be on a note what theyve done is wrong they didnt give him a chance to call anybody they didnt give him a chance to have a lawyer they put him in a room for three hours and just interrogated him and interrogated him so it wasnt done correctly they didnt follow procedure i think they saw him they noticed him and they used him as a target he wasnt carrying anything he wasnt under the influence or any drugs i think its just a misunderstanding hes been unfortunate where hes been to a party somehow cocaine has got either on his wallet or on his cards were not sure he didnt know anything about it he went to the airport to fly they checked and he is racking his brain about how this could happen he hasnt done anything he wasnt carrying anything hes had tests that have come back clean he has had hair sample a blood test and urine sample which are absolutely clean a hair sample can last up to five months so that proves he hasnt taken anything i think it will be fine because its not like he has done anything due to his demanding schedule filming hitshow stranger things in los angeles yorkshireborn heaton is not believed to see his son regularly the youngster lives with his mother who performs in the band the big pink in london it is

      " aly raisman details the alleged assaults that she endured for years while being treated by dr larry nassar in her new book fierce  she writes that it all began when she was 15 and practicing through her pain in australia ahead of a meet a usa gymnastics official suggested that she get treated by dr nassar saying that the registered osteopath who was a volunteer with the organization could help her sore heels and back pain i didnt want to be labeled as uncooperative so finally i said okay writes raisman she immediately realized something was different than her previous treatments but said nothing at the time there was something about the massage that made me uncomfortable but the staff members words stuck in my head states raisman this is the same story many of nassars accusers have told alleging that he would digitally penetrate them anally and vaginally with ungloved hands under the guise of treatment raisman who is the most high profile victim to emerge has said that she will not go into specific detail about nassars alleged abuse scroll down for video raisman writes that she was told it was an honor to be treated by dr nassar and for that reason she stayed silent thats probably why i didnt question why larry would sometimes close his eyes or seem out of breath when he worked on me writes raisman i felt guilty for thinking badly of someone everyone else liked raisman reveals though that she never had these experiences with other doctors when i lay on my stomach to have my hamstrings worked on towels were draped over my hips and buttocks for privacy and to ensure there was no inappropriate skintoskin contact they never ever crossed any lines in where they massaged writes raisman and there was never a moment when their methods made me uncomfortable it was different with larry she goes on to say i would lie on the table my hands involuntarily balling themselves into fists as his ungloved hands worked their way under my clothing treatment sessions with him always made me feel tense and uncomfortable raisman began to realize over the years that other girls also had this issue while attending camps around the country it was at one of those camps that during a conversation with one girl she said i feel like if it wasnt okay he wouldve already been fired someone would have said something it it was wrong that is what may have kicked off the investigation into nassar reveals raisman who writes that a coach who overheard her comment told an official with usa gymnastics alarm bells went off in her head writes raisman and then she did the right thing she spoke up the investigation into dr nassar also caused problems for raisman however who says she justified his behavior and when she asked to speak with the investigator again having realized she was being assaulted raisman says that usa gymnastics asked her to stop speaking about nassar with any other person usa gymnastics said earlier this week that they were appalled by the allegations against nassar stating we are committed to doing what is right and we want to work with aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe raisman previously accused some topranking officials at usa gymnastics of abhorrent behavior claiming that she and her teammates from the 2016 rio games were ignored by a table of executives from the sports governing body during their hall of fame induction this summer that childish display came shortly after raisman spoke with the fbi and detailed how she was allegedly abused by dr nassar under the guise of treatment raisman also claimed that usa gymnastics stopped her from speaking with the fbi after she tried to seek out the female agent she first spoke with about nassar  before she realized she was being abused by the doctor after her initial interview raisman came to realize she herself was a victim and tried to speak again with that agent that is when usa gymnastics stepped in she claims and stopped her outreach shortly after she left it hit me and i reached back out to an official with usa gymnastics and i said i have to speak to her again i was making excuses for him and its not right raisman said on monday while appearing on megyn kelly today i was not given a courtesy of speaking with her and was told to just mind your own business despite this personal tragedy and what many see as a huge failure of usa gymnastics to protect young women like raisman the twotime olympic team captain confirmed monday morning on today that she will be back for the 2020 games in tokyo dr nassar denies the allegations of all his accusers he is currently behind bars in a michigan prison after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography in july authorities revealed back in december of last year that they had discovered over 37000 images and videos of child pornography featuring girls as young as six and a go pro video of nassar molesting a group of young girls in a pool over 130 women have come forward to accuse nassr including raismans olympic teammate mckayla maroney many of these women including raisman and maroney claim they were underage at the time of their first alleged assault raisman revealed that she justified dr nassars behavior to the fbi investigator at first because she was so under his spell viewing him as a friend i said you know well he  his touching makes me uncomfortable but hes so nice to me said the sixtime medal winner and i dont think he does it on purpose because you know i think he cares about me raisman then noted i think its important for people to know too im still trying to put the pieces together today you know it impacts you for the rest of your life she was also being treated alone by the doctor despite that being against both usa gymnastics and us olympic policy nobody ever educated me on make sure youre not alone with an adult you know make sure hes not making you uncomfortable i didnt know the signs i didnt know what sexual abuse really was said raisman and i think that needs to be communicated to all of these athletes no matter the age the entire situation was made all the more confusing said raisman because of dr nassars behavior he would always bring me you know desserts or gifts he would buy me little things so i really thought he was a nice person said raisman i really thought he was looking out for me thats why i want to do this interview thats why i wanna talk about it i want people to know just because someone is nice to you and just because everyone is saying theyre the best person it does not make it okay for them to ever make you uncomfortable ever it was after the rio games when she finally spoke with the fbi a move she claims left some in the sport angry at both her and her final five teammates there was a table of a lot of people that are very high up in usa gymnastics that were in the room and they didnt come over said raisman you know my teammates and i were all sitting at the table and they did not come over to say hi to us or to congratulate us raisman who would become the first american woman since dominique dawes to compete at three olympic games should she qualify for tokyo later said all weve done is worked really hard we love the sport and we were treated like you know we dont want anything to do with you girls she was then asked if she had any concern about what repercussions might arise because she spoke out you know i think thats a very valid point said raisman but i think that this speaking out and creating positive change so that athletes are safe is more important than any olympic medal you could ever win raismans parents said on 60 minutes that they too were completely caught off guard when they learned about what had happened to their daughter we were there but if shes not knowing that its wrong  never in a million years did i ever even think to say hey when you see the team doctor is there someone with you said her mother lynn she was then asked what she could change if she had the chance to go back in time i think the most important thing if anyone takes anything away from this interview is sit down with your kids and explain to them that predators arent just strangers said lynn they can be highly educated they can be very wellrespected in the community it could be a family member it could be a family friend so you know thats really the i mean if i could go back in time i would do that on today raisman said that her interview already empowered one young girl to speak out about her alleged abuser i actually got a letter 36 hours after i spoke up in august i was so nervous about speaking up i spoke out against usa gymnastics and i got a letter from a 14yearold girl and she said she read my statements and because of that she had the courage to tell her mother that her father had been sexually abusing her said raisman and he threatened her life at times i realize that letter is more important to me than any medal ive ever won in my life she changed my life because she made me realize this is the right thing raisman continued and if i can help one person you know thats totally what its all about and she no longer sees nassar as a friend i think hes a monster its disturbing what he did to me and other people its bigger than just me said raisman its such a horrific thing to happen and i stand here with all the other survivors that have been abused by larry and other people that have been abused by anyone its disgusting it was during the metoo campaign last month when maroney shared her story claiming nassar began abusing her when she 13 and that the assaults did not stop until she left the sport just last year at the age of 20 dr nassar told me that i was receiving medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years maroney 21 said of her abuse in a social media post it seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance i was treated it happened in london before my team and i won the gold medal and it happened before i won my silver maroney also detailed what she said was the worst incident back in 2011 during a trip to tokyo she claimed that on the way to the world championship that year nassar gave her a sleeping pill and the she awoke to find him performing a treatment on her in the hotel i thought i was going to die that night wrote maroney she was just 15 at the time soon after she shared her story her teammates from the 2012 games all voiced their support on social media with raisman posting a photo of herself and maroney hugging with a heart emoji raisman also wrote 100 support you so proud of you and your strength love you like a sister \n",

      " zimbabwes military has stormed the countrys national broadcasters studios to declare it is targeting criminals amid fears of a coup after reports of explosions and gunfire in the capital the military read a statement on live tv claiming this not a military takeover of government and president robert mugabe was safe the us embassy in zimbabwe had ordered employees and us citizens in the african nation to take cover and seek shelter on tuesday after gunfire was heard near the home of the 93yearold president sparking fears of an armed military takeover soldiers stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster zbc in the early hours of wednesday two members of staff and a human rights worker told reuters as staff complained they were manhandled by the military members after taking control of the station the military released a statement which denied a coup was underway adding that mugabe and his family were safe and sound and their security is guaranteed they added that the army were targeting people who were committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country as soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy the statement continued tensions have been rising in the landlocked african country after zimbabwes head of the military general constantino chiwenga challenged mugabe over his decision to sack the vice president emmerson mnangagwa the move was widely seen as a power play to make way for his wife grace to succeed him chiwenga had threatened that the army could step in to end president mugabes purge of opponents on monday the ruling zanupf party hit back at the threat saying it would never succumb to military pressure and described the statement by the armed forces chief as treasonable conduct  tanks had been making their way to the city center throughout the day as tensions reached boiling point then at least three explosions were heard in harare sparking fears of a coup which sent shockwaves around zimbabwe armed soldiers were also reportedly seen assaulting passersby in the capital and loading ammunition near a group of four military vehicles in an unprecedented challenge to mugabe the zimbabwean presidents house where gunfire was heard this morning was also surrounded by soldiers but speculation suggested it was for his own protection amid suggestions his 37year reign was coming to an end zimbabwes envoy to south africa isaac moyo had earlier reported there was no coup adding that the government was intact in harare in the early hours of this morning aggressive soldiers told passing cars to keep moving through the darkness dont try anything funny just go one barked at a reporter on harare drive two hours later soldiers overran the headquarters of the zbc zimbabwes state broadcaster and a principal mugabe mouthpiece and ordered staff to leave shortly afterwards three explosions rocked the center of the southern african nations capital witnesses said despite the troops stationed at locations across harare there was no word from the military as to the fate of mugabe zimbabwes leader of the last 37 years and the selfstyled grand old man of african politics the us embassy in zimbabwe on wednesday warned its citizens in the country to shelter in place due to ongoing political uncertainty as the crisis deepened us citizens in zimbabwe are encouraged to shelter in place until further notice the embassy in harare said in a statement tanks rolled into zimbabwes capital last night leaving the nation in political chaos as its army chief was accused of attempting a coup the turmoil in harare was an unprecedented test of dictator mugabes 37year grip on power it came a day after the countrys most powerful generals warned the 93yearold president he risked a coup if he continued a purge of senior figures in his ruling zanupf party many fear the sackings could clear the way for his wife grace 52 to succeed him it comes after vice president emmerson mnangagwa  nicknamed the crocodile  was fired by mugabe last week mr mnangagwa 75 who has close ties to the military had been seen as mugabes natural sucessor and after he was ousted he took aim at mugabe and his supporters he said said zanupf was controlled by undisciplined egotistical and selfserving minnows who derive their power not from the people and the party but from only two individuals in the form of the first family ministers tried to dismiss reports of an unfolding coup last night as fake news but speculation was rife that mugabe and his family were about to be forced out his party said it would never succumb to military pressure and accused army chief general constantino chiwenga of treasonable conduct because of his threat to step in to end the political purge armoured military vehicles were spotted on key roads inside the capitals suburbs and there were reports of heavily armed soldiers enforcing a lockdown at mugabes mansion and at the headquarters of the state broadcaster two witnesses described seeing a military convoy near westgate shopping centre six miles from central harare one a fruit seller said i saw a long convoy of military vehicles including tanks social media users said the army headquarters in the city centre were sealed off with no one allowed in or out and that road blocks were in place outside the barracks of the presidential guard others said they had seen tanks heading towards the presidential guard compound in the western suburb of dzivarasekwa conflicting reports from the impoverished southern african country claimed the borders had been sealed and the airport shut although others insisted reports of a coup had been exaggerated regime officials insisted mugabe had chaired a planned cabinet meeting in the afternoon as usual and claimed footage of military vehicles had been faked although witnesses inside the city described seeing tanks many images circulating online showed troops in armoured personnel carriers a media blackout appeared to be in force and there were conflicting reports from inside harare about the extent of military manoeuvres and whether a coup was underway or whether the military was simply putting on a show of force to back up its previous threat to step in the military has been a key pillar of mugabes regime and has helped him keep control despite economic ruin widespread antigovernment protests opposition challenges and international sanctions but there has been growing disquiet over threats against senior figures inside zanupf including mr mnangagwa the veteran of the seventies war that led to the countrys independence fell from favour after he spoke out against a party faction led by mrs mugabe saying it was plundering the country after mugabe accused him of using witchcraft in a plot to take power mr mnangagwa fled the country with his family but vowed to return and lead a rebellion against the mugabes backed by the countrys war veterans and armed forces before he went into exile mr mnangagwa told mugabe that zanupf was not personal property for you and your wife to do as you please his ousting was widely interpreted as a bid to ensure mrs mugabe would become vice president at a special conference of the ruling party next month leaving her as the natural successor to her husband as president surrounded by 90 senior army officers general chiwenga called this week for an end to the sacking of senior figures linked to the partys revolution against white minority rule in the seventies he said we must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution the military will not hesitate to step in his comments put him on a collision course with the mugabe regime which has listed disciplinary measures against more than 100 senior officials linked to mr mnangagwa zanupf issued a statement accusing the commander of treasonable conduct and said his comments were clearly calculated to disturb national peace and stability and to incite insurrection mugabe has previously warned military leaders against interfering in the fight for succession in july he told supporters politics shall always lead the gun and not the gun politics otherwise it will be a coup opposition politicians have said a military coup would damage zimbabwe because it would be undemocratic last night the foreign office updated its advice for people traveling to zimbabwe it said we are aware of reports of military vehicles moving on the outskirts of harare we are monitoring the situation closely you should avoid political activity or activities which could be considered political including political discussions in public places and criticism of the president you should avoid all demonstrations and rallies the authorities have sometimes used force to suppress demonstrations despite the reports of the tanks zimbabwes ruling party zanu pf took to twitter to deny rumours of a coup thanks for your concerns there is no coup happening in zimbabwe please continue with your lives and face up to your own problems earlier on tuesday the youth wing of zimbabwes ruling party accused zimbabwe army chief chiwenga of subverting the constitution for threatening military intervention nowsacked vicepresident mnangagwa 75 a veteran of zimbabwes 1970s liberation wars had been viewed as a likely successor to mugabe before the president fired him on november 6 but grace mugabe 52 has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling zanu pf party and they have endorsed her to replace mr mnangagwa though no announcement has yet been made her rise has brought her into conflict with the independenceera war veterans  who have increasingly been banished from senior government and party roles in recent years mugabe who is nearly 94 years old is the only leader zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence  first as the chair of the zimbabwe african national union zany then as leader of the zany party as prime minister and then president under mugabes leadership the gdp of zimbabwe has fallen by almost 50 per cent according to the united nations the country suffered badly during the recession and experienced hyperinflation and a widespread lack of food and other essentials things have slightly recovered but are still significantly worse than when the family took power meanwhile the mugabes themselves live their lives bathing in eyewatering luxury the couples two sons chatunga and his brother robert jr are wellknown for their hard partying and have been seen flashing their riches on social media this week chatunga posted a video of himself pouring hundreds of pounds worth of champagne over a £45000 diamondencrusted

diplomacy even while beijing has long been frustrated with pyongyangs provocations and unwillingness to reform its economy however song is not directly connected to chinas efforts to convince pyongyang to cease its nuclear weapons program and return to talks downplaying the chances for a breakthrough in that highly contentious area china is also north koreas largest trading partner and chief source of food and fuel aid although it says its influence with kims regime is often exaggerated by the us and others while it is enforcing harsh new un sanctions targeting the norths sources of foreign currency beijing has called for steps to renew dialogue beijing is also opposed to measures that could bring down kims regime possibly depriving it of a buffer with south korea and the almost 30000 us troops stationed there and leading to a refugee crisis and chaos along its bother with the north in beijing last week trump urged xi to pressure north korea to give up its nuclear weapons program china can fix the problem easily and quickly trump said in remarks to journalists alongside xi he urged xi to hopefully work on it very hard if he works on it hard it will happen theres no doubt about it trump said while calling the visit significant a top chinese expert on north korea relations downplayed any connection with trumps statements in beijing saying it fit a pattern of traditional exchanges between the two parties following significant events such as national congresses representatives are dispatched to brief the other side at a chosen time and chosen level it is a tradition and it is unnecessary to connect it with trumps visit to china said guo rui researcher at the institute for north korean and south korean studies at jilin university in northeastern china however he said the visit shows chinas willingness to see a continuous development of the friendly relations between the two sides although the korean peninsula situation has been evolving fast with worrisome indications the two parties are maintaining normal exchanges and that is of significance for stabilizing the bilateral relations and the peninsular situation guo said the nature of songs visit as a partytoparty exchange rather than one between the two governments appears to paint it as a bilateral attempt to strengthen relations said john delury a professor at seouls yonsei university who specializes in korea and china the fact that song was identified as xis special envoy also suggests that xi is personally making a push to open the channel at a higher level and engage more constructively with kim delury said this is a chance to see if he can open things up he said the relationship has been so frosty it will be interesting to see if theres some improvement in the bilateral ties north korea staged its sixth nuclear test on sept 3 detonating what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb and last launched a ballistic missile on sept 15 firing it over the japanese island of hokkaido into the pacific ocean since then there has been a lull in such activity leading to some hopes in beijing that pyongyang might be responding to international pressure and becoming more amenable to talks songs visit to pyongyang also comes as china and south korea are repairing their relations with south korean president moon jaein scheduled to visit next month for talks with xi previously warm ties soured last year over seouls decision to deploy a sophisticated us missile defense system aimed at guarding against north korean threats beijing claimed the thaad system damaged its own security because its radars could observe military movements within northeastern china and retaliated by banning chinese tour groups from visiting and interfering in the china operations of south korean companies while south korea resisted chinas demands to withdraw the system beijing appeared satisfied with a pledge from seoul not to expand it among other commitments  associated press

      " its not a case of we bring the standards down to accommodate the new people coming in the standards are the standards and everyone catches up you catch up quickly or you get left behind and then you dont make the next squad  rory best march 2016 irelands habit of hitting the straps in the opening match of a test window has become an encouraging feature of the joe schmidt era last saturdays annihilation of south africa was the 11th time in 13 blocks of fixtures since winter 2013 that he has guided his team to victory the meticulous coach might often be heard bemoaning his squads lack of training time when they are heading back into action following a long break away however his concern is frequently misplaced as the pressure he puts on his squad to deliver excellent firstup performances despite limited prep keeps delivering results to savour look at the ledger last saturdays rout of the springboks was preceded by the historic opening win over the all blacks this time last year in total all four november series openers have been won under schmidt so too all three june tour openers a first world cup warmup and also a first match at a world cup no doubt ireland have made it their business to launch test windows with a winning smile they put their best foot forward from the off in the 2014 and 2015 titlewinning six nations campaigns even though there were slow starts to their subsequent 2016 and 2017 championships with the second halfimplosion in the draw with wales 21 months ago and the infamous busgate defeat to scotland last february it shows winning starts arent easy to achieve just ask neighbours wales who have been beaten in eight of their 13 recent test window openers the latest setback coming last saturdays against australia ireland under eddie o sullivan and declan kidney also had their firstday inconsistencies osullivan losing nine of 21 and kidney six of 14 schmidts ireland though possess this ability to get up to speed straight away and it could be an invaluable skill to have given the significance of what is on the horizon  a twoyear run that includes mustwin fixtures such as away to france firstup in the 2018 six nations and later the pool opening showdown against scotland at the 2019 world cup assistant coach richie murphy ducks for cover when asked why irelands opening day strike rate is so positive i dont know why that is he said yesterday the dust having settled on another satisfying test window opener the one thing i would say is that the core of the players that are coming back in have an understanding of what is expected of them there is a clear guideline and game plan on both sides of the ball set out for the guys so its easy for them to get up to speed with what we are trying to do that has to be part of the reason maybe that guys feel comfortable when they come in but the other part of it that is quite good is the sharing guys work hard with each other and with the new guys when they come in in order to try and bring them up to speed this wasnt always the case schmidts skipper rory best cutting a sorry sight last year when trying to explain why ireland had uncharacteristically misfired at the start of 2016 there is a massive pressure there in training and its something as a player group we let off the first couple of weeks he said during a miserable campaign where the opening day draw to wales was the precursor to draining defeats in paris and london we let some of our standards away in training because we wanted to build confidence because everyone was talking us down we maybe went a wee bit too much instead of going look if you dont catch up you are going to be left behind that is the environment we have created and that is why when the young guys come in the first thing they do is they spend a lot of time studying plays studying where they need to be so if something goes wrong they are not the ones that get it wrong there is a lot around that that is the framework we play to with ireland having once more put their best foot put forward on weekend one the onus to prepare assiduously now falls on what is set to be a rejigged team to face fiji on saturday schmidts sides are consistent at backing up fine windowopening displays winning in week two on eight of the 10 occasions after they have won in week one but saturday will bring an added pressure as home matches against nontier one oppositions seldom attract sellout crowds this game will it shows you the interest in irish rugby at the moment reasoned murphy yesterday as michael bent was drafted in as tighthead cover while dave kilcoyne and james ryan sat out training but both are expected to be fine for the weekend its an opportunity to maybe see one or two guys who dont play that regularly for ireland and see some new guys coming through if you looked at training this week there is a real buzz the tightness within the group is really easy to see but then theres massive competition between the players below that everybody realises that if you dont work together for the common good noone goes forward ireland are going forward judging by their latest firstday

      " while you might think that opting for a new haircut or style is as simple as pointing at a celebrity and saying recreate this on me to your hairdresser it pays to be a little more prepared when you walk into a salon with this in mind sydney based celebrity hairdresser anthony nader  spoke to daily mail australia about which hairstyle works for which face shape from ovalshaped like the duchess of cambridge  to round like emma stone here femail reveals how to get your best locks ever before christmas  oval face for anyone with this face shape just remember youre lucky  according to anthony this is the most perfect shape the ovalshaped face has got the symmetry and even dimension for you and your hair stylist to have fun creating different hair shapes  because of its evenness anthony explained the haircut can also have fun with layers around the face  either short or long among the celebrity examples with this face shape are selma hayek julianne moore and kate middleton you can also embrace the 70s vibe with this and have your hair one length and long  your facial features will still look incredible he added round face while anthony admits that having a round face can be tricky he also has a few celebrity gotos who quite simply nail the style emma stone mila kunis and kirsten dunst rock a round face he explained if youre thinking of trying a bob i would go for a wob  thats basically a wavy bob this will help to camouflage and soften a round face shape he added that having a side swept fringe complements and elongates this face type if you want to wear your hair down you can also go in a totally opposite direction and iron your hair poker straight making sure you keep the shape closed in around the cheekbones anthony said reason why it disguises the apples of your cheeks and the wideness of your jawline rather than having layers that flick out and expose the roundness square face even though you might think that a square face needs an angular cut in fact the opposite is true for a square face the ideal haircut is not angular and boxlike as this is only going to emphasise the squareness of your jawline and the outline and width of your forehead anthony said instead he said its always best to soften the corners of your face by adding a wave or a curl or even having your hairdresser cut an offcentre fringe that sweeps dramatically over to one side for those of you that have a pixielike haircut just be sure to keep the hair around your hair and neckline a bit longer and softer he advised this will always camouflage the bone structure of your face celebrity examples of this style are natalie portman sandra bullock and olivia wilde rectangular face if your face is cut something like meryl streeps liv tylers and sarah jessica parkers then you need to add volume at the cheekbones to make your face look more oval in shape i would also suggest a long overgrown curtain fringe that is shorter in the middle and blends out longer on the corners and sweeps off as this is the perfect fringe for shortening the face anthony said opt for an offcentre parting to offset the symmetrical shape of your face and if youre pulling your hair back then do something back and low rather than back and high heart face between reese witherspoon halle berry and kourtney kardashian the heartshaped face is wellrepresented in the celebrity set but how should you style your locks if your face is shaped like an emoji incorporate a soft high swept fringe to accentuate your eyes and draw away the focus from a pointy chin anthony said one thing to note however is that you need to ensure you dont have a blunt straight fringe and that the edges of it are cut below the edge of the brows with soft texture if youve got a bob thats all one length this helps to counteract the narrowness of the jawline because youre creating width in the right areas the top hairdresser added long face finally if you have a long face like blake lively alexa chung or jessica alba  who all wear their godgiven looks fabulously  then you need texture and a fringe to add width bobs will also suit a longer face shape as this creates an illusion of shortening the face which is key anthony said have fun creating waves and a haphazard bend in the hair which will give you the extra oomph and add width anthony concluded by saying that youll notice that people like blake lively avoid too much volume on the top of their head as this only emphasises the length of the face and what youre trying to detract from keep your volume from the temple down he said for more information about anthony nader visit his raw salon website here  \n",

      " catwoman jocelyn wildenstein and her fiancé lloyd klein have been spotted out at a sothebys art auction just days after they were arrested for domestic abuse the couple were ordered to keep away from each other last week after a lovers spat turned violent and landed them both in handcuffs but the 72yearold socialite who is famous for her plastic surgery catlike enhanced features and her boyfriend were seen at the impressionist and modern art auction at sothebys in new york on tuesday the pair even appeared in matching outfits with klein wearing black leather pants and gloves and wildenstein in a black leather fur and tassel ensemble they reportedly sat together in the front row of the elite art auction a source told dailmailcom it is unclear whether wildenstein who has been dubbed catwoman and klein 50 breached their protective orders by attending the same event the couple who both live in apartments in trump world tower were supposed to keep their distance from each other and even avoid getting in the same elevator kleins attorney david moreno told tmz they were reportedly planning to avoid each other after their arrests but it seems that neither could pass up the chance to bid on artwork at the auction on tuesday tmz reported that wildenstein and klein were having dinner on november 5 when a plate that was left inside the oven shattered after accidentally overheating around 1am tmz reported for whatever reason the incident sparked a heated argument between the couple that quickly turned physical wildenstein who has been dubbed catwoman claims that 50yearold klein pushed her to the ground which caused bruising to her arm and neck klein claims that wildenstein viciously scratched him on the forehead causing a cut they both apparently sought treatment at a nearby hospital and were both charged with misdemeanor assault this is not their first runin with the law as theyve been arrested several times for fighting last december they were involved in a blazing late night argument that resulted in wildenstein getting arrested for scratching kleins face and chest klein escaped by bundling her into a closet but wrongly believing she was trapped she called the police herself igniting a tabloid storm in the process shocked klein would face the ignominy of arrest himself when days later police accused him of pushing her when he went back to collect his belongings the pair were banned from going within 1000 yards of one another or communicating by phone email or text but wildenstein said they continued to message in secret  like naughty schoolchildren in the back of class authorities dropped all charges after they both insisted the incident was blown out of all proportion and they were still in love the fight was just one night it could have destroyed our relationship but it didnt wildenstein said told dailymailcom in august we were not supposed to speak directly afterwards but he sent me sweet messages through friends i think the police made too much out of the incident the police officer put his fingers into my skin so deeply that he left me with a scar but this is just the circle of life bad things happens just like the car crash you cannot erase them but we never change who we are back in august the pair announced they were engaged after he bought the 32carat diamond engagement ring and proposed at the versace mansion in miami in september the cashstrapped wildenstein put her sprawling new york apartment back on the market after defaulting on her $45 million mortgage the 72yearold had listed the 5160squarefoot trump world tower apartment in midtown east for $11 million the property  located at 845 united nations plaza  failed to sell for its $129 million asking price through a different agent earlier this year wildenstein snapped up adjoining apartments in 2001 before buying a third and knocking them into one giant pad that takes up nearly the entire 51st floor the divorcee spent millions of dollars on plastic surgery to make her look catlike and once explained that she wanted the surgery to make her eyes look more feline she paid around $6 million for all three but borrowed millions more to upgrade the eightbedroom sixbathroom residence and deck it out in an opulent art deco interior court documents obtained by dailymailcom in september showed wildenstein had defaulted on the $45 million mortgage she took out 10 years ago on the apartment her exasperated creditors have tried to slap foreclosure papers on the famed socialite but the felinefeatured debtor has been dodging them concierge and security staff at the glitzy high rise have also refused to help and threatened to call police on anyone who tries to drop off the paperwork the banks surveillance operatives had even resorted to staking out the premises but on both occasions failed to spot wildenstein in a separate legal action dailymailcom earlier revealed that trump world tower itself was also chasing her for $81332 in unpaid common charges dating back to november 2014 wildenstein became the worlds most infamous divorcee in 1999 when she landed a thenrecord $25 billion settlement from her late exhusband the art dealer alec wildenstein but shes been candid about her depleted finances in recent interviews accusing her exhusbands family of cutting off her multimillion dollar annual maintenance \n",

      " zimbabwes military has stormed the countrys national broadcasters studios to declare it is targeting criminals amid fears of a coup after reports of explosions and gunfire in the capital the military read a statement on live tv claiming this not a military takeover of government and president robert mugabe was safe the us embassy in zimbabwe had ordered employees and us citizens in the african nation to take cover and seek shelter on tuesday after gunfire was heard near the home of the 93yearold president sparking fears of an armed military takeover soldiers stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster zbc in the early hours of wednesday two members of staff and a human rights worker told reuters as staff complained they were manhandled by the military members after taking control of the station the military released a statement which denied a coup was underway adding that mugabe and his family were safe and sound and their security is guaranteed they added that the army were targeting people who were committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country as soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy the statement continued tensions have been rising in the landlocked african country after zimbabwes head of the military general constantino chiwenga challenged mugabe over his decision to sack the vice president emmerson mnangagwa the move was widely seen as a power play to make way for his wife grace to succeed him chiwenga had threatened that the army could step in to end president mugabes purge of opponents on monday the ruling zanupf party hit back at the threat saying it would never succumb to military pressure and described the statement by the armed forces chief as treasonable conduct  tanks had been making their way to the city center throughout the day as tensions reached boiling point then at least three explosions were heard in harare sparking fears of a coup which sent shockwaves around zimbabwe armed soldiers were also reportedly seen assaulting passersby in the capital and loading ammunition near a group of four military vehicles in an unprecedented challenge to mugabe the zimbabwean presidents house where gunfire was heard this morning was also surrounded by soldiers but speculation suggested it was for his own protection amid suggestions his 37year reign was coming to an end zimbabwes envoy to south africa isaac moyo had earlier reported there was no coup adding that the government was intact in harare in the early hours of this morning aggressive soldiers told passing cars to keep moving through the darkness dont try anything funny just go one barked at a reporter on harare drive two hours later soldiers overran the headquarters of the zbc zimbabwes state broadcaster and a principal mugabe mouthpiece and ordered staff to leave shortly afterwards three explosions rocked the center of the southern african nations capital witnesses said despite the troops stationed at locations across harare there was no word from the military as to the fate of mugabe zimbabwes leader of the last 37 years and the selfstyled grand old man of african politics the us embassy in zimbabwe on wednesday warned its citizens in the country to shelter in place due to ongoing political uncertainty as the crisis deepened us citizens in zimbabwe are encouraged to shelter in place until further notice the embassy in harare said in a statement tanks rolled into zimbabwes capital last night leaving the nation in political chaos as its army chief was accused of attempting a coup the turmoil in harare was an unprecedented test of dictator mugabes 37year grip on power it came a day after the countrys most powerful generals warned the 93yearold president he risked a coup if he continued a purge of senior figures in his ruling zanupf party many fear the sackings could clear the way for his wife grace 52 to succeed him it comes after vice president emmerson mnangagwa  nicknamed the crocodile  was fired by mugabe last week mr mnangagwa 75 who has close ties to the military had been seen as mugabes natural sucessor and after he was ousted he took aim at mugabe and his supporters he said said zanupf was controlled by undisciplined egotistical and selfserving minnows who derive their power not from the people and the party but from only two individuals in the form of the first family ministers tried to dismiss reports of an unfolding coup last night as fake news but speculation was rife that mugabe and his family were about to be forced out his party said it would never succumb to military pressure and accused army chief general constantino chiwenga of treasonable conduct because of his threat to step in to end the political purge armoured military vehicles were spotted on key roads inside the capitals suburbs and there were reports of heavily armed soldiers enforcing a lockdown at mugabes mansion and at the headquarters of the state broadcaster two witnesses described seeing a military convoy near westgate shopping centre six miles from central harare one a fruit seller said i saw a long convoy of military vehicles including tanks social media users said the army headquarters in the city centre were sealed off with no one allowed in or out and that road blocks were in place outside the barracks of the presidential guard others said they had seen tanks heading towards the presidential guard compound in the western suburb of dzivarasekwa conflicting reports from the impoverished southern african country claimed the borders had been sealed and the airport shut although others insisted reports of a coup had been exaggerated regime officials insisted mugabe had chaired a planned cabinet meeting in the afternoon as usual and claimed footage of military vehicles had been faked although witnesses inside the city described seeing tanks many images circulating online showed troops in armoured personnel carriers a media blackout appeared to be in force and there were conflicting reports from inside harare about the extent of military manoeuvres and whether a coup was underway or whether the military was simply putting on a show of force to back up its previous threat to step in the military has been a key pillar of mugabes regime and has helped him keep control despite economic ruin widespread antigovernment protests opposition challenges and international sanctions but there has been growing disquiet over threats against senior figures inside zanupf including mr mnangagwa the veteran of the seventies war that led to the countrys independence fell from favour after he spoke out against a party faction led by mrs mugabe saying it was plundering the country after mugabe accused him of using witchcraft in a plot to take power mr mnangagwa fled the country with his family but vowed to return and lead a rebellion against the mugabes backed by the countrys war veterans and armed forces before he went into exile mr mnangagwa told mugabe that zanupf was not personal property for you and your wife to do as you please his ousting was widely interpreted as a bid to ensure mrs mugabe would become vice president at a special conference of the ruling party next month leaving her as the natural successor to her husband as president surrounded by 90 senior army officers general chiwenga called this week for an end to the sacking of senior figures linked to the partys revolution against white minority rule in the seventies he said we must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution the military will not hesitate to step in his comments put him on a collision course with the mugabe regime which has listed disciplinary measures against more than 100 senior officials linked to mr mnangagwa zanupf issued a statement accusing the commander of treasonable conduct and said his comments were clearly calculated to disturb national peace and stability and to incite insurrection mugabe has previously warned military leaders against interfering in the fight for succession in july he told supporters politics shall always lead the gun and not the gun politics otherwise it will be a coup opposition politicians have said a military coup would damage zimbabwe because it would be undemocratic last night the foreign office updated its advice for people traveling to zimbabwe it said we are aware of reports of military vehicles moving on the outskirts of harare we are monitoring the situation closely you should avoid political activity or activities which could be considered political including political discussions in public places and criticism of the president you should avoid all demonstrations and rallies the authorities have sometimes used force to suppress demonstrations despite the reports of the tanks zimbabwes ruling party zanu pf took to twitter to deny rumours of a coup thanks for your concerns there is no coup happening in zimbabwe please continue with your lives and face up to your own problems earlier on tuesday the youth wing of zimbabwes ruling party accused zimbabwe army chief chiwenga of subverting the constitution for threatening military intervention nowsacked vicepresident mnangagwa 75 a veteran of zimbabwes 1970s liberation wars had been viewed as a likely successor to mugabe before the president fired him on november 6 but grace mugabe 52 has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling zanu pf party and they have endorsed her to replace mr mnangagwa though no announcement has yet been made her rise has brought her into conflict with the independenceera war veterans  who have increasingly been banished from senior government and party roles in recent years mugabe who is nearly 94 years old is the only leader zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence  first as the chair of the zimbabwe african national union zany then as leader of the zany party as prime minister and then president under mugabes leadership the gdp of zimbabwe has fallen by almost 50 per cent according to the united nations the country suffered badly during the recession and experienced hyperinflation and a widespread lack of food and other essentials things have slightly recovered but are still significantly worse than when the family took power meanwhile the mugabes themselves live their lives bathing in eyewatering luxury the couples two sons chatunga and his brother robert jr are wellknown for their hard partying and have been seen flashing their riches on social media this week chatunga posted a video of himself pouring hundreds of pounds worth of champagne over a £45000 diamondencrusted

      " washington ap  senate republicans are intent on scrapping the affordable care acts requirement that americans get health insurance targeting a repeal of the individual mandate to help finance deep tax cuts in their tax overhaul sen orrin hatch chairman of the finance committee confirmed late tuesday he was revising the bill to include repeal of the insurance mandate to help provide additional relief to low and middleincome families the surprise renewal of the failed effort to scrap the laws mandate came a day after president donald trump renewed pressure on gop lawmakers to include the repeal in their tax legislation it has sharp political stakes for trump who lacks a major legislative achievement after nearly 10 months in office the move by republicans on the senate finance committee upended the debate over the tax measure just as it was inching closer to passage following months of finetuning and compromise it turned the debate into an angry partisan referendum on health care and president barack obamas signature law republican efforts to dismantle the law collapsed this past summer as moderate republicans joined with democrats in rejecting the repeal  a bitter disappointment for trump who lashed out at the senate gop for failing adding the repeal of the mandate to the tax measure would combine two of trumps legislative priorities beyond trumps prodding the repeal move also was dictated by the republicans need to find revenue sources for the massive taxcut bill which calls for steep reductions in the corporate tax rate and elimination of some popular tax breaks we are optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful thats obviously the view of the senate finance committee republicans majority leader mitch mcconnell rky told reporters the obamacare mandate requires most people to buy health insurance coverage or face a fine without being forced to get coverage fewer people would sign up for medicaid or buy federally subsidized private insurance targeting the mandate in the tax legislation would save an estimated $338 billion over a decade which could be used to help pay for the deep cuts the congressional budget office has estimated repealing the requirement that people buy health coverage would mean 4 million additional uninsured people by 2019 and 13 million more by 2027 it will cause millions to lose their health care and millions more to lose their premiums sen ron wyden of oregon the senior democrat on the finance committee angrily insisted when the panel reconvened to work on the tax bill and word came of the republicans move on the mandate feeling ambushed without advance notice minority democrats exploded in anger the completed house tax bill pointed toward a vote in that chamber thursday does not currently include repeal of the health insurance mandate trump plans an inperson appeal to house republicans before the vote to win over moderate senate republicans to the tax legislation the senate may take up at the same time a bipartisan compromise to shore up health care subsidies sen john thune rsd indicated tuesday thune is a member of the finance panel hatchs revised version also doubles the child tax credit to $2000 from the current $1000  a change that presidential daughter ivanka trump has pushed for the credit would rise to $1600 under the house bill outside congress as word spread of the senate republicans intention major organizations representing insurers doctors and hospitals urged lawmakers to keep obamacares unpopular requirement that most americans have health insurance  at least for now ending the individual mandate would prompt healthy people to leave the insurance market in droves driving up premiums the groups argued in a letter tuesday to congressional leaders republican sens rand paul of kentucky and tom cotton of arkansas had pushed for the repeal in the tax bill just months after gop efforts to dismantle the 2010 health care law had collapsed in the senate repealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the irs for not being able to afford insurance that obamacare made unaffordable in the first place cotton said in a statement congressional republicans projected confidence earlier in the day about delivering the legislation this bill will make things better for hardworking americans house speaker paul ryan rwis told reporters house gop leaders rallied support with the rankandfile at a closeddoor meeting earlier in the senate panels work on the bill the democrats complained that the bill would enable us corporations with foreign operations and wealthy individuals and families to exploit loopholes to skirt millions in taxes on monday a nonpartisan analysis of the senate bill showed it would increase taxes for some 138 million moderateincome american households promoted as needed relief for the middle class the house and senate bills would deeply cut corporate taxes double the standard deduction used by most americans and limit or repeal completely the federal deduction for state and local property income and sales taxes republican leaders in congress view passage of the first major tax revamp in 30 years as imperative for the gop to preserve its majorities in next years elections  associated press writers kevin

and thames house home of mi5 are busy at computer terminals and video mixing desks preparing bulletins and programmes and telling the news kremlinstyle stateoftheart equipment allows for slick sophisticated graphics that mimic the output of respectable international news broadcasters such as the bbc  cnn and france 24 but there is nothing respectable about russia today known by the more friendly acronym rt whose uk offices these are from the tower block in which new labour moulded the news agenda 20 years ago another agenda is being peddled one serving a foreign master with no love for britain rt is a direct mouthpiece for the russian government its global operations funded by the kremlin to the tune of some £200 million yearly part of a media campaign waged relentlessly to undermine confidence in democracy and sow discord in countries regarded by moscow as adversaries in her speech at the lord mayors banquet in the city of london on monday theresa may mounted an outspoken attack on president putins fake news accusing the kremlin of weaponising information in one of the strongest verbal attacks on russia in recent years the prime minister warned we know what you are doing it comes as almost 45000 messages about brexit were tweeted from russian twitter accounts in just 48 hours during last years referendum the times reported more than 150000 russianbased accounts switched their attention from subjects such as the ukrainian conflict to brexit in the leadup to the vote according to research by swansea university and the university of california berkeley rt is a formidable operation broadcasting to some 100 countries via satellite television and the internet and now featuring tailormade programming for us and uk viewers as well as services in french spanish and arabic but this is not about information  its about disinformation rt is just one component in what russian intelligence refers to as an active measures campaign so effective that it may have influenced to a substantial degree the outcome of the 2016 us presidential election propelling donald trump into the white house at the expense of hillary clinton be it rt broadcasting on multichannel television or its sister news agency sputnik which has an office in edinburgh on the internet be it social media campaigns on facebook and twitter or the hacking of emails belonging to mrs clinton there is but one end and that is the furtherance of putins foreign and domestic aims russia todays diet is a curious mix outlandish conspiracy theories promoted by cranks masquerading as serious commentators vie with more subtle coverage pushing the russian line on syria ukraine and elsewhere wikileaks founder julian assange american philosopher and social commentator noam chomsky and former baywatch bombshell pamela anderson have all graced rts programmes at some time or another hosts include the veteran political maverick george galloway and curiously former cnn flagship interviewer larry king now there is a new star in putins media firmament it was announced last week that scotlands former first minister the snps alex salmond is to host a new discussion programme on rt covering politics entertainment and business mr salmond justifies his acceptance of moscow gold by pointing out that no fewer than 50 labour mps 37 conservatives and 17 snp members have appeared on rt in the past two years and he promises total editorial control but political opponents  and several fellow snp politicians  have attacked his decision to consort with putin as an astonishing lack of judgment nicola sturgeon salmonds protege who succeeded him as first minister said she would have advised against the deal had she been consulted in the lookingglass world of rt accuracy is a flexible commodity at one time or another we have been told that 911 was an inside job perpetrated by the american government and that the bbc stagemanaged a bogus chemical attack in syria to discredit the regime of russian ally president bashar alassad weve also been informed that the malaysian airliner downed by a missile over eastern ukraine in 2014 with great loss of life was the responsibility of the ukrainian government and not as is generally accepted the work of russianbacked separatists the us congress has been hearing this month about the extent of active measures instructed by putin in early 2016 to influence the race for the white house fuelled by his fear and distrust of mrs clinton the us intelligence community has judged with high confidence that putin did indeed order a campaign of mainstream media social media and hacking to influence the us vote the trump administration has subsequently been dogged by allegations of collusion with moscow fuelled by disclosures of links between the russians and the presidential campaign team last week trump appeared to accept an assurance by putin that he had ordered no such campaign saying his russian opposite number was insulted by such a suggestion but the us president has since rowed back on his remark reaffirming his confidence in his own intelligence services the sharp end of the kremlins global disinformation campaign is to be found in the internet research agency in st petersburg colourfully known as the troll factory where young operatives labour to hack sites create bogus news sites and pump out fake news and social media messages a tweet in march from this troll factory or another very similar setup  so it is believed  sought to stoke racial tensions in the uk by featuring a woman in a hijab speaking on her mobile phone and apparently ignoring a victim of the westminster bridge terrorist attack in fact the woman had been traumatised by the incident and was phoning her family to tell them she was safe the bogus tweet which went viral purported to come from a resident of texas under the twitter handle south lone star but had been generated by russian internet trolls such trolls also posted antiimmigration and probrexit messages around the time of the eu referendum items on rt and sputnik which usually command only small audiences are turboboosted on social media in concerted campaigns which attract hundreds of thousands of views rts tv audience in the uk is tiny  less than one per cent  but its real power lies on youtube where its output is enjoyed by some two million subscribers viewers are initially lured to watch it by video footage of tsunamis and other dramatic visual events which may then lead them on to more politically sensitive items margarita simonyan editorinchief of rt is quite unapologetic about the tv stations ultimate loyalties the word propaganda has a very negative connotation but indeed there is not a single international foreign tv channel that is doing something other than promotion of the values of the country that it is broadcasting from she says when russia is at war we are of course on russias side simonyan is one of numerous rt executives with close links to the moscow establishment in recent years her intray has filled with complaints from the british media regulator ofcom accusing rts operation of repeatedly violating rules on impartiality and producing broadcasts on ukraine syria and elsewhere that are materially misleading yet little is done to curb its activities the most egregious violations by rt tend to occur when it is covering conflicts such as ukraine and syria in which the russian government is directly involved according to ben nimmo of the atlantic council thinktank founded in 2005 rt was tasked specifically by putin a former kgb officer with ending anglosaxon hegemony in international broadcasting part of active measures is decomposition which involves the destruction of personal reputations and the cohesion and influence of target nations this can be seen in scotland where rts sister organisation sputnik which broadcasts on the internet from its bureau in edinburgh produces stories aimed at undermining the union and the british nuclear deterrent based on the clyde rt itself has been anxious to draw parallels between the nationalist movements in scotland and catalonia stories aimed at keeping the independence debate alive north of the border a diminished uk with no nuclear force is of course a prime aim of putin and his inner circle 70 per cent of whom are drawn from the ranks of the intelligence services to add a veneer of respectability rt has recruited british journalists including rory suchet son of former itn newsreader john suchet but it is understood that rt is finding it increasingly difficult to recruit experienced journalists in the west because of its reputation as a kremlin mouthpiece there is a similar problem with guests most mainstream politicians in britain now preferring to keep their distance jeremy corbyn a regular face on rt before his election as labour leader now largely avoids the station despite the allegedly prorussian sympathies of his spin doctor seumas milne but shadow lord chancellor and leftwing mp richard burgon is a regular guest as are ukips nigel farage and julian assange who broadcasts via video link from his refuge in the ecuadorean london embassy some mps have even received fees to appear including labours chris williamson and rosie duffield and tory david tc davies the backbench mp for monmouth not to be confused with the brexit secretary who between them received £3000 in total according to the register of members interests why elected members feel it is appropriate to profit from appearing on a foreign propaganda station is unclear there is certainly disquiet among some of those who have worked for rt about its editorial standards sara firth a british journalist resigned from rt after being pressured into twisting the story of the shooting down of malaysian flight mh17 to blame ukraine rather than a russian surfacetoair system operated by prorussian rebels our coverage of the mh17 plane disaster was the final nudge she explained following her resignation id been really unhappy for a long time at rt i just couldnt do it any more we were running an eyewitness account that made an accusation against ukraine and we had a correspondent in the studio who was asked to produce something about a plane that had been shot down at some point in the past and had been the fault of ukraine in other words to suggest that the ukrainian government had form for doing such a thing ive been in that position myself before where youre asked to bring up some piece of obscure information that implies something that fits with the rt agenda and you think well its not outright lying but it has no relation to whats happening and shouldnt be run at a time when a story of that size is breaking  a news story that is so sensitive its abhorrent and indefensible nikolay bogachikhin rt news chief in london was unapologetic during a bbc interview when speaking about the channels middle east coverage we are bringing stories that matter from the russian perspective he explained russia is a big player the russian view of the situation in syria and ukraine is so much different from the western vision mr bogachikhin denied that rt receives calls from the kremlin demanding that it adopts a particular editorial line regarding mr corbyn he explained jeremy was quite a frequent guest and we valued and treasured his commentary always but we now try not to call him because appearing on rt is seen as very detrimental we see now that everything to do with russia is toxic this is sad because we would like to have some antirussian voices some debate mr nimmo of the thinktank atlantic council argues that russias propaganda campaign is aimed as much at a russian audience as a western one portraying western democracy as weak and rotten and in particular playing on immigration fears hillary clinton became a prime target for putin he says only when she backed antigovernment protests in russia while us secretary of state deeply offending the russian president last years election tampering can be seen as putins revenge the office of the us director of national intelligence in its assessment of russian attempts to manipulate the us election said of the station the rapid expansion of rts operations and budget and recent candid statements by rts leadership point to the channels importance to the kremlin as a messaging tool and indicate a kremlindirected campaign to undermine faith in the us government and fuel political protest the kremlin has committed significant resources to expanding the channels reach particularly its social media footprint rt is now an established part of the media landscape and it is not going away on the 16th floor of millbank tower the rt functionaries are beavering away behind their screens and it can mean no good for the country that offers them a home \n",

      " by amanda becker and susan cornwell washington nov 14 reuters  us senate republicans on tuesday linked repealing a key component of obamacare to their ambitious taxcut plan raising new political risks and uncertainties for the tax measure that financial markets have been monitoring closely for months in comments that infuriated democrats and left some senior republicans unsure what comes next senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told reporters were optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful and thats obviously the view of the senate finance committee republicans as well the finance panel which had been in session for two days abruptly adjourned on tuesday as democrats slammed the republicans handling of their tax proposals for which formal legislative language has still not been unveiled ron wyden the committees top democrat demanded more time for democrats to discuss the issue because we were never told that healthcare was going to be part of it and this just flew in literally out of nowhere in the last 20 minutes tying obamacare to the tax program introduces new risks for the republicans and for president donald trump together they have yet to score a major legislative win since trump took power in january even with control of congress and the white house the president who has struggled in his relations with congress suggested in a tweet on monday that the mandate repeal should be added to the tax plan following up on a similar nov 3 tweet no final decision on such a move was made at the senate republicans weekly luncheon senator susan collins told reporters afterward she played a key role in julys collapse of a yearslong push by fellow republicans to gut obamacare former democratic president barack obamas signature healthcare law formally known as the affordable care act i personally think that it complicates tax reform to put the repeal of the individual mandate in there collins said asked if she would back the tax bill if a mandate repeal were added she said im going to wait and see senator john mccain who was also central to his partys failed obamacare repeal earlier this year was noncommittal on putting the mandate repeal in the tax plan saying i want to see the whole bill before i decide the senate and house of representatives are developing separate taxcut packages they plan to reconcile eventually and send to trumps desk for enactment into law an outcome republicans are eager to achieve so they can face us voters next year with at least one major legislative achievement house speaker paul ryan asked why the repeal of the obamacare mandate was not in the house version of the tax proposal told fox news on tuesday we didnt want to complicate tax reform make it harder than it otherwise would be the house had already agreed to eliminate the mandate in a healthcare bill it passed in may he noted adding we want to see the senate go first and see if they can get that done and then well discuss whether or not its included at the end the trump administration strongly supports the house version of the tax legislation saying its passage would be an important first step in achieving comprehensive tax reform the white house said in a statement on tuesday us financial markets have been watching closely with us stocks rallying in recent months partly on hopes of business tax cuts they showed little reaction to tuesdays developments crucial element of obamacare the individual mandate requires americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty to washington a provision that republicans have long opposed as government overreach but the mandate plays a critical role in obamacare by requiring young healthy people who might otherwise go without coverage to purchase insurance and help offset the costs of covering sicker and older americans underscoring the devastating consequences for obamacare if the mandate were repealed the nonpartisan congressional budget office said last week that such a change would increase the number of americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027 the cbo added that mandate repeal would raise the average insurance policy premiums in the obamacare marketplaces by about 10 percent annually over the next decade repealing the mandate would also lower the federal deficit by $338 billion over the same time period the cbo said a finding that several republican senators said influenced the move eliminating the individual mandate would lower the number of americans with health insurance meaning the federal government would spend less on subsidizing coverage for lower and middleincome people making that money available to pay for tax cuts neither the senate nor the house tax plans now includes repealing the mandate but both plan would add about $15 trillion over 10 years to the federal deficit and the national debt which now exceeds $20 trillion congressional republicans hope to pass tax legislation by the end of the year and are moving fast despite uncertainties they hold only a razorthin 5248 majority in the senate if democrats remain united in opposition republicans could afford to lose no more than two senators from within their own ranks and still secure passage of tax legislation democrats have dismissed the republican plans as deficitexpanding giveaways to corporations and the wealthy representative lloyd doggett a senior member of the house tax committee said in a statement that the house tax bill was just a way to curry favor with washington special interests  awarding tax windfalls to large multinational corporations and the fortunate few that sit way atop the economic ladder additional reporting by richard cowan

      " historymaking ashes captain michael vaughan has placed the onus on englands magnificent seven to get the tourists out of the ground chillingly dubbed the gabbatoir unscathed next week vaughan who masterminded englands first series win over australia in 18 years back in 2005 believes a refusal to become fresh meat for the baggy green butchers will be key to 201718 incumbent joe roots hopes of retaining the urn australia have a stunning record at brisbanes gabba of 21 wins and seven draws stretching back to their last defeat against viv richards 1988 west indies vintage and a ben stokesless england will have their work cut out to prevent 21 successes becoming 22 but  in debating the series alongside fellow bt sport commentator graeme swann  vaughan places his faith in the experienced core to produce a repeat of the 201011 stalemate you would hope the others come through it but history tells you there are not many fresh players arrive in brisbane and produce magic vaughan said it will come down to that senior group of seven  alastair cook jonny bairstow moeen ali chris woakes jimmy anderson stuart broad root himself included  to perform joe should focus on them and say come on lads its our week this week we cant be reliant on the four relatively inexperienced players we will try to drag them along but its down to us seven to get this job done vaughan who won player of the 200203 series for his 633 runs acknowledges the top six is englands main weakness  although is quick to point out similar vulnerability in the australian equivalent david warner and steve smith excepted and following england coach trevor bayliss demand to turn warmup 60s into testmatch 160s he says the tourists batsmen need to develop mental pictures of how to construct hundreds in australian conditions with the new ball you have to be careful and the only advice i would give the top order would be to allow their bowlers like mitchell starc and josh hazlewood to have their first spells and earn the right to get the runs later vaughan said dont try to be smart or aggressive i know david warner will do that but he s a different player leave it on bounce let it go through to the keeper get under a few then when it gets to those second spells you can capitalize if you are in by the third and fourth spells  its christmas that really is the time to climb in you have to have belief in your own game and allow the bigger picture to happen while looking after the smaller detail break everything down into the process of what you need to do you have to survive that first ball to get off the mark be able to get to five be able to get to 10 get your first boundary then repeat it before you know it you are on 30 alastair cook got 700 runs in that 201011 series because he just repeated that cut shot and flick off the hip the pull shot only came out when he got to about 50 he danced down to the leftarm spinners about three times in the whole series to hit them over midwicket otherwise he just nudged them off his hip i am not saying everyone should play the same way the point is he had a game plan and an awareness of exactly what he was trying to achieve if you dont have that and simply think you can go out and play youll get found out in your own mind you have to have a vision of what a hundred would look like and they will look different for every individual one for james vince will look different to one for joe root for example but if he pictures it he has got a chance in contrast to the frenetic pace of englands 2015 victory on home soil vaughan also believes developing a longergame tempo will be more beneficial down under and if england can remain in matches heading into the fourth and fifth days it will test swanns theory that moeen  a reluctant lead spinner who nevertheless has 128 test victims to his name  can be as influential with ball as bat he can expect a barrage of short bowling when he bats because hes proved to be slightly susceptible to it said swann but i think he will do well because hes a brilliant brilliant batsman i hope he starts believing he is a brilliant bowler as well whenever he doesnt get an early wicket you see the confidence ebb and drain away and i dont think england have actually nailed how to treat him yet tell him how good he is because hes worldclass with the ball when he wants to be yet when mo bowls in test matches i dont think he expects to take five wickets  and thats where he goes wrong a lot of the time he should expect to take fivefors when he bowls hes happy taking two for 60 two for 70 and getting a hundred i would be very happy with that as well but hes better than that mitchell starc a leftarmer is going to play the full series there is going to be a big foothole and the aussies cant play spin when its spinning you ve just watched them in india right watch the ashes exclusively live on bt sport with coverage of the first test from 11pm wednesday 22nd november

have made it their business to launch test windows with a winning smile they put their best foot forward from the off in the 2014 and 2015 titlewinning six nations campaigns even though there were slow starts to their subsequent 2016 and 2017 championships with the second halfimplosion in the draw with wales 21 months ago and the infamous busgate defeat to scotland last february it shows winning starts arent easy to achieve just ask neighbours wales who have been beaten in eight of their 13 recent test window openers the latest setback coming last saturdays against australia ireland under eddie o sullivan and declan kidney also had their firstday inconsistencies osullivan losing nine of 21 and kidney six of 14 schmidts ireland though possess this ability to get up to speed straight away and it could be an invaluable skill to have given the significance of what is on the horizon  a twoyear run that includes mustwin fixtures such as away to france firstup in the 2018 six nations and later the pool opening showdown against scotland at the 2019 world cup assistant coach richie murphy ducks for cover when asked why irelands opening day strike rate is so positive i dont know why that is he said yesterday the dust having settled on another satisfying test window opener the one thing i would say is that the core of the players that are coming back in have an understanding of what is expected of them there is a clear guideline and game plan on both sides of the ball set out for the guys so its easy for them to get up to speed with what we are trying to do that has to be part of the reason maybe that guys feel comfortable when they come in but the other part of it that is quite good is the sharing guys work hard with each other and with the new guys when they come in in order to try and bring them up to speed this wasnt always the case schmidts skipper rory best cutting a sorry sight last year when trying to explain why ireland had uncharacteristically misfired at the start of 2016 there is a massive pressure there in training and its something as a player group we let off the first couple of weeks he said during a miserable campaign where the opening day draw to wales was the precursor to draining defeats in paris and london we let some of our standards away in training because we wanted to build confidence because everyone was talking us down we maybe went a wee bit too much instead of going look if you dont catch up you are going to be left behind that is the environment we have created and that is why when the young guys come in the first thing they do is they spend a lot of time studying plays studying where they need to be so if something goes wrong they are not the ones that get it wrong there is a lot around that that is the framework we play to with ireland having once more put their best foot put forward on weekend one the onus to prepare assiduously now falls on what is set to be a rejigged team to face fiji on saturday schmidts sides are consistent at backing up fine windowopening displays winning in week two on eight of the 10 occasions after they have won in week one but saturday will bring an added pressure as home matches against nontier one oppositions seldom attract sellout crowds this game will it shows you the interest in irish rugby at the moment reasoned murphy yesterday as michael bent was drafted in as tighthead cover while dave kilcoyne and james ryan sat out training but both are expected to be fine for the weekend its an opportunity to maybe see one or two guys who dont play that regularly for ireland and see some new guys coming through if you looked at training this week there is a real buzz the tightness within the group is really easy to see but then theres massive competition between the players below that everybody realises that if you dont work together for the common good noone goes forward ireland are going forward judging by their latest firstday bonanza  \n",

      " aly raisman details the alleged assaults that she endured for years while being treated by dr larry nassar in her new book fierce  she writes that it all began when she was 15 and practicing through her pain in australia ahead of a meet a usa gymnastics official suggested that she get treated by dr nassar saying that the registered osteopath who was a volunteer with the organization could help her sore heels and back pain i didnt want to be labeled as uncooperative so finally i said okay writes raisman she immediately realized something was different than her previous treatments but said nothing at the time there was something about the massage that made me uncomfortable but the staff members words stuck in my head states raisman this is the same story many of nassars accusers have told alleging that he would digitally penetrate them anally and vaginally with ungloved hands under the guise of treatment raisman who is the most high profile victim to emerge has said that she will not go into specific detail about nassars alleged abuse scroll down for video raisman writes that she was told it was an honor to be treated by dr nassar and for that reason she stayed silent thats probably why i didnt question why larry would sometimes close his eyes or seem out of breath when he worked on me writes raisman i felt guilty for thinking badly of someone everyone else liked raisman reveals though that she never had these experiences with other doctors when i lay on my stomach to have my hamstrings worked on towels were draped over my hips and buttocks for privacy and to ensure there was no inappropriate skintoskin contact they never ever crossed any lines in where they massaged writes raisman and there was never a moment when their methods made me uncomfortable it was different with larry she goes on to say i would lie on the table my hands involuntarily balling themselves into fists as his ungloved hands worked their way under my clothing treatment sessions with him always made me feel tense and uncomfortable raisman began to realize over the years that other girls also had this issue while attending camps around the country it was at one of those camps that during a conversation with one girl she said i feel like if it wasnt okay he wouldve already been fired someone would have said something it it was wrong that is what may have kicked off the investigation into nassar reveals raisman who writes that a coach who overheard her comment told an official with usa gymnastics alarm bells went off in her head writes raisman and then she did the right thing she spoke up the investigation into dr nassar also caused problems for raisman however who says she justified his behavior and when she asked to speak with the investigator again having realized she was being assaulted raisman says that usa gymnastics asked her to stop speaking about nassar with any other person usa gymnastics said earlier this week that they were appalled by the allegations against nassar stating we are committed to doing what is right and we want to work with aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe raisman previously accused some topranking officials at usa gymnastics of abhorrent behavior claiming that she and her teammates from the 2016 rio games were ignored by a table of executives from the sports governing body during their hall of fame induction this summer that childish display came shortly after raisman spoke with the fbi and detailed how she was allegedly abused by dr nassar under the guise of treatment raisman also claimed that usa gymnastics stopped her from speaking with the fbi after she tried to seek out the female agent she first spoke with about nassar  before she realized she was being abused by the doctor after her initial interview raisman came to realize she herself was a victim and tried to speak again with that agent that is when usa gymnastics stepped in she claims and stopped her outreach shortly after she left it hit me and i reached back out to an official with usa gymnastics and i said i have to speak to her again i was making excuses for him and its not right raisman said on monday while appearing on megyn kelly today i was not given a courtesy of speaking with her and was told to just mind your own business despite this personal tragedy and what many see as a huge failure of usa gymnastics to protect young women like raisman the twotime olympic team captain confirmed monday morning on today that she will be back for the 2020 games in tokyo dr nassar denies the allegations of all his accusers he is currently behind bars in a michigan prison after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography in july authorities revealed back in december of last year that they had discovered over 37000 images and videos of child pornography featuring girls as young as six and a go pro video of nassar molesting a group of young girls in a pool over 130 women have come forward to accuse nassr including raismans olympic teammate mckayla maroney many of these women including raisman and maroney claim they were underage at the time of their first alleged assault raisman revealed that she justified dr nassars behavior to the fbi investigator at first because she was so under his spell viewing him as a friend i said you know well he  his touching makes me uncomfortable but hes so nice to me said the sixtime medal winner and i dont think he does it on purpose because you know i think he cares about me raisman then noted i think its important for people to know too im still trying to put the pieces together today you know it impacts you for the rest of your life she was also being treated alone by the doctor despite that being against both usa gymnastics and us olympic policy nobody ever educated me on make sure youre not alone with an adult you know make sure hes not making you uncomfortable i didnt know the signs i didnt know what sexual abuse really was said raisman and i think that needs to be communicated to all of these athletes no matter the age the entire situation was made all the more confusing said raisman because of dr nassars behavior he would always bring me you know desserts or gifts he would buy me little things so i really thought he was a nice person said raisman i really thought he was looking out for me thats why i want to do this interview thats why i wanna talk about it i want people to know just because someone is nice to you and just because everyone is saying theyre the best person it does not make it okay for them to ever make you uncomfortable ever it was after the rio games when she finally spoke with the fbi a move she claims left some in the sport angry at both her and her final five teammates there was a table of a lot of people that are very high up in usa gymnastics that were in the room and they didnt come over said raisman you know my teammates and i were all sitting at the table and they did not come over to say hi to us or to congratulate us raisman who would become the first american woman since dominique dawes to compete at three olympic games should she qualify for tokyo later said all weve done is worked really hard we love the sport and we were treated like you know we dont want anything to do with you girls she was then asked if she had any concern about what repercussions might arise because she spoke out you know i think thats a very valid point said raisman but i think that this speaking out and creating positive change so that athletes are safe is more important than any olympic medal you could ever win raismans parents said on 60 minutes that they too were completely caught off guard when they learned about what had happened to their daughter we were there but if shes not knowing that its wrong  never in a million years did i ever even think to say hey when you see the team doctor is there someone with you said her mother lynn she was then asked what she could change if she had the chance to go back in time i think the most important thing if anyone takes anything away from this interview is sit down with your kids and explain to them that predators arent just strangers said lynn they can be highly educated they can be very wellrespected in the community it could be a family member it could be a family friend so you know thats really the i mean if i could go back in time i would do that on today raisman said that her interview already empowered one young girl to speak out about her alleged abuser i actually got a letter 36 hours after i spoke up in august i was so nervous about speaking up i spoke out against usa gymnastics and i got a letter from a 14yearold girl and she said she read my statements and because of that she had the courage to tell her mother that her father had been sexually abusing her said raisman and he threatened her life at times i realize that letter is more important to me than any medal ive ever won in my life she changed my life because she made me realize this is the right thing raisman continued and if i can help one person you know thats totally what its all about and she no longer sees nassar as a friend i think hes a monster its disturbing what he did to me and other people its bigger than just me said raisman its such a horrific thing to happen and i stand here with all the other survivors that have been abused by larry and other people that have been abused by anyone its disgusting it was during the metoo campaign last month when maroney shared her story claiming nassar began abusing her when she 13 and that the assaults did not stop until she left the sport just last year at the age of 20 dr nassar told me that i was receiving medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years maroney 21 said of her abuse in a social media post it seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance i was treated it happened in london before my team and i won the gold medal and it happened before i won my silver maroney also detailed what she said was the worst incident back in 2011 during a trip to tokyo she claimed that on the way to the world championship that year nassar gave her a sleeping pill and the she awoke to find him performing a treatment on her in the hotel i thought i was going to die that night wrote maroney she was just 15 at the time soon after she shared her story her teammates from the 2012 games all voiced their support on social media with raisman posting a photo of herself and maroney hugging with a heart emoji raisman also wrote 100 support you so proud of you and your strength love you like a sister \n",

reuters witnesses said despite the troops stationed at locations across harare there was no word from the military as to the fate of mugabe zimbabwes leader of the last 37 years and the selfstyled grand old man of african politics in contrast to his elevated status on the continent mugabe is reviled in the west as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of africas most promising states in the only official word from the government isaac moyo zimbabwes ambassador to neighbouring south africa earlier dismissed talk of a coup saying the government was intact and blaming social media for spreading false information theres nothing really happening they are just social media claims moyo told reuters the southern african nation has been on edge since monday when chiwenga commander of the zimbabwe defence forces said he was prepared to step in to end a purge of supporters of sacked vice president emmerson mnangagwa only a few months ago mnangagwa a former security chief nicknamed the crocodile was favourite to succeed his lifelong political patron but was ousted a week ago to pave the way for mugabes 52yearold wife grace to succeed him politics over the gun chiwengas unprecedented statement represented a major escalation of the struggle to succeed mugabe the only leader zimbabwe has known since it gained independence from britain in 1980 mugabe chaired a weekly cabinet meeting in the capital on tuesday officials said and afterwards zanupf said it stood by the primacy of politics over the gun and accused chiwenga of treasonable conduct  meant to incite insurrection the previous day chiwenga had made clear the armys refusal to accept the removal of mnangagwa  like the generals a veteran of zimbabwes anticolonial liberation war  and the presumed accession of grace once a secretary in the government typing pool local government minister saviour kasukuwere a leading figure in her relatively youthful g40 faction refused to answer reuters questions about the situation in harare im in a meeting he said before hanging up shortly before midnight army police and government spokesmen refused to answer numerous phone calls asking for comment defending our revolution neither mugabe nor grace have responded in public to chiwengas remarks and state media did not publish his statement the herald newspaper posted some of the comments on its twitter page but deleted them the head of zanupfs youth wing which openly backs grace accused the army chief of subverting the constitution defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for youth league leader kudzai chipanga said at the partys headquarters in harare grace mugabes rise has brought her into conflict with the independenceera war veterans who enjoyed privileged status in zimbabwe until the last two years when they spearheaded criticism of mugabes handling of the economy in the last year a chronic absence of dollars has led to long queues outside banks and an economic and financial collapse that many fear will rival the meltdown of 20072008 when inflation topped out at 500 billion percent imported goods are running out and economists say that by some measures inflation is now at 50 percent a month according to a trove of intelligence documents reviewed by reuters this year mnangagwa has been planning to revitalise the economy by bringing back thousands of white farmers kicked off their land nearly two decades ago and patching up relations with the likes of the world bank and imf whatever the outcome analysts said the military would want to present their move as something other than a fullblown coup to avoid criticism from an africa keen to leave behind the cold war continental stereotype of generals being the final arbiters of political power a military coup is the nuclear option said alex magaisa a ukbased zimbabwean academic a coup would be a very hard sell at home and in the international community they will want to avoid that additional reporting by ed cropley james macharia and joe

      " it is one of the most soothing sounds in the english countryside but the buzzing of bumblebees as they fly from flower to flower has been altered by pesticides making it harder for them to collect pollen monitoring the bees with microphones british researchers found neonicotinoid pesticides affect buzz pollination  the vibrations used by the stripy insects to explode pollen out of flowers those exposed to the chemicals collected around half the amount of pollen the studys lead author dr penelope whitehorn from the university of stirling said our findings have implications for the effects of pesticides on bee populations as well as the pollination services they provide they also suggest that pesticide exposure may impair bees ability to perform complex behaviours such as buzz pollination last week environment secretary michael gove backed a europewide ban on neonicotinoids which are intended to defend crops from insects like weevils and aphids but also harm bees ability to forage for food and reproduce a study in october found threequarters of honey samples from every continent except antarctica were laced with at least one of these pesticides  which act as nerve agents the latest research studied captive colonies of bumblebees visiting buzzpollinated flowers monitoring their behaviour scientists analysed the acoustic signal produced during buzz pollination to detect changes in buzzing behaviour through time they found longterm exposure to neonicotinoid pesticide at similar levels to those found in agricultural fields interfered with the vibrations of the bees dr whitehorn said we found that control bees which were not exposed to the pesticide improved their pollen collection as they gained experience which we interpreted as an ability to learn to buzz pollinate better however bees that came into contact with pesticide did not collect more pollen as they gained more experience and by the end of the experiment collected between 47 per cent and 56 per cent less pollen compared to the control bees bumblebees usually feed through gathering pollen on their hairy bodies or using their tongues with shorttongued insects feeding on flowers with short nectar tubes and longtongued bees having evolved to choose different plants buzz pollination is needed when these strategies fail in plants like blueberry cranberry and senna flowers which have evolved to keep a tighter hold on their tightlypacked pollen in this case bumblebees contract their flight muscles which produces strong vibrations resulting in an explosion of pollen which can be collected from their fur and deposited into the pollen baskets on their hind legs the researchers want to explore whether pesticides affect the memory and cognitive ability of bumblebees which are important in complex behaviours like this type of pollination responding to the study published in the journal scientific reports friends of the earths sandra bell said this study adds to the overwhelming stack of evidence that neonicotinoid pesticides harm bees  this time showing that these chemicals could hamper bumblebees ability to pollinate some of our favourite fruits by buzz pollination farmers across the uk are already successfully farming without neonics  the government and nfu must do far more to help farmers to produce the food we all need without beeharming chemicals \n",

      " apple is developing a radical rear facing laser camera to allow augmented reality apps to be even more realistic it has been claimed bloomberg says the technology could be included in the firms 2019 iphone lineup  just a year before it is expected to introduce its first ar spectacles the new camera will use a laser to bounce light pulses off objects and measure how far away they are a technique known as time of flight according to bloomberg scroll down for video  by analysing these measurements the iphone can build up a picture of its surroundings in june patently apple revealed apple was granted a  patent application for the technology apple noted in their patent filing that the system also comprises a light source such as a laser 22 which is driven by a laser driver to direct a light beam through a doe which typically comprises a diffractive lens one of the engineers credited in the patent jawad nawasra is also credited with another 3d mapping patent titled timeofflight depth mapping with flexible scan pattern it explains imaging apparatus includes an image sensor which acquires an image of a scene and a scanner which includes an optical transmitter which emits a sequence of optical pulses toward the scene and an optical receiver which receives the optical pulses reflected from the scene and generates an output indicative of respective times of flight of the pulses a processor identifies an object in the image of the scene defines the nonrectangular area so as to contain the identified object and processes the output of the optical receiver so as to extract a threedimensional 3d map of the object google is also experimenting with a similar system for its android phones and has already produced handsets under its project tango it comes amid claims apple s augmented reality glasses could be on shelves by 2020 it has been claimed codenamed t228 they will run a version of apples ios called reality os according to bloombergs mark gurman apple aims to have technology ready for an augmentedreality headset in 2019 and could ship a product as early as 2020  he says apples device will have its own display and run on a new chip and operating system according to people familiar with the situation it is believed the software will be a fork of the ios software on iphones and ipads  similar to the version created for the apple watch it has been named ros for reality operating system a secret team team is working on several hardware and software projects under the umbrella code name of t288 it is claimed it is believed the firm is taking its time to make sure the technology is ready anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with tim cook recently told the independent when talking about the firms ar plans jony ive told the new yorkers techfest conference last month the iphone x and its screen had faced a similar issue saying there are certain ideas that we have and we are waiting for the technology to catch up with the idea the firm is believed to be investigating touch panels voiceactivation via siri and head gestures to control the glasses and a recent apple ar glasses patent details a headmounted touchscreen display that could work alongside an iphone according to bloomberg engineers are prototyping applications from mapping to virtual meeting rooms and 360degree video playback using htc vive headsets a special development kit similar to samsungs gear vr and googles daydream using as iphone as a screen is also being made although it is believed it will only be used internally to develop apps for the new glasses rumors that apple is planning to bring introduce augmented reality  smart glasses have been swirling since march in july it was revealed that the tech giant filed a patent application showing how the ar glasses would work now its reported that catcher technology a taiwanese company that manufactures metal casings for apple products may also make parts for apples ar glasses  allen horng the chairman of catcher technology did not confirm what project his company is working on but there has been speculation that its working on apples ar product  given that the company already works with apple on its product casings based on what we have learned new ar products need to look good and be light enough to wear  that makes the casings for such device very complicated to manufacture and there are still a lot of challenges to overcome currently allen horng said in an earnings conference on tuesday november 7th the apple ar glasses patent details a headmounted touchscreen display that could work alongside an iphone it also presents a way of representing points of interest a landmark or an object such as a moving car in a view of a real environment on an iphone screen with interaction functionality as such the iphone could potentially connect to the ar headset allowing the wearer to see point of interest in real time this is particularly useful for ar apps such as tour guides for exploring new cities jeff pu an analyst yuanta investment consulting told nikkei asian review that apples ar glasses could go on sale at the end of 2019 the patent was the work of ar software development firm metaio which apple acquired in may 2015 after it developed thermal touch  a way to trigger actions in digital content via a persons heat signature apple ceo tim cook has called augmented reality ar a big idea and people will have ar experiences every day almost like eating three meals a day   \n",
