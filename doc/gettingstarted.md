# Getting started with INCA
## Hints for everyone who is wants to get involved in helping with the project

In this document, students and colleagues new to INCA find some useful links for getting started. In particular, it lists some ressources where you can brush up your skills regarding the tools we use. Please add anything you find useful to this doc.

## Editing this document
This document is written in Markdown. Also other files, like README or TODO files are written in Markdown. It's very simple, you can find instructions here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

## git
Rather than mailing back-and-forth files or giving them names like myscript1_version22.py and myscript3535_april3.py, we use a version control system that allows us to track changes and work together on one project. It's called git, and using it can be a bit intimidating at first. But once you got used to it, you'll love it! Some links to learn more:

## Common Linux tools
While in principle, INCA is platform-independent and can be run on any platform, chances are very high you will (also) work on a platform that runs Linux.

If you want to fresh up your knowledge of the Linux shell, have a look here:

Most things you need will also be covered in this book:

To edit text files from the Linux command line, you have several editors at your disposal:

- `vim' (for the nerdy people among you)
- `nano' (easy to use, but no advanced functionality)
- `emacs' (offers a lot of nice things, including syntax highlighting). You can get a nice reference card for printing out and putting on your wall here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf
